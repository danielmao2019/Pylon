# SiameseKPConv for 3D Point Cloud Change Detection

This module provides a standalone implementation of SiameseKPConv for 3D point cloud change detection, based on the original [torch-points3d-SiameseKPConv](https://github.com/humanpose1/torch-points3d-SiameseKPConv) repository but without dependencies on the torch_points3d framework.

## Architecture

SiameseKPConv is a siamese network based on KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) for detecting changes between two point clouds of the same area captured at different times:

1. **Encoder**: Both point clouds are processed through the same KPConv-based encoder to extract features
2. **Feature Differencing**: Corresponding points between the two point clouds are found using kNN, and their features are subtracted
3. **Decoder**: The difference features are processed through a decoder with skip connections
4. **Classification**: A final MLP classifies each point as changed or unchanged

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

- **KPConv operator**: Defines convolution kernels as sets of points in space
- **SimpleBlock**: Basic KPConv block with convolution -> batch norm -> activation
- **ResnetBBlock**: Bottleneck Resnet block for KPConv with residual connections
- **KPDualBlock**: Combines multiple blocks for more complex processing

## Usage

```python
from models.change_detection.siamese_kpconv.siamese_kpconv_model import SiameseKPConv

# Initialize model
model = SiameseKPConv(
    in_channels=3,            # Number of input features per point
    out_channels=2,           # Number of output classes
    point_influence=0.1,      # Radius of influence for each kernel point
    down_channels=[32, 64],   # Feature dimensions for encoder layers
    up_channels=[64, 32],     # Feature dimensions for decoder layers
    conv_type='simple'        # Type of convolution blocks
)

# Input format (two point clouds)
inputs = {
    'pc_0': {  # First point cloud
        'pos': pos_tensor_1,    # [N, 3] point positions
        'x': feat_tensor_1,     # [N, C] point features
        'batch': batch_tensor_1 # [N] batch indices
    },
    'pc_1': {  # Second point cloud
        'pos': pos_tensor_2,
        'x': feat_tensor_2,
        'batch': batch_tensor_2
    }
}

# Forward pass
change_logits = model(inputs)  # [N, num_classes] - raw logits, not softmax probabilities
```
