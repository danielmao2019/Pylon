## Overview

The `DynamicThreadPoolExecutor` is a sophisticated, resource-aware thread pool implementation designed for parallel execution of compute-intensive tasks in machine learning workflows. It provides automatic scaling based on system resource utilization while maintaining strict equivalency with sequential execution, including fail-fast error handling.

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts worker count based on CPU and GPU utilization
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of system resources with smart scaling decisions
- **Fail-Fast Error Handling**: Identical error behavior to sequential execution (for loops)
- **Order Preservation**: Maintains result ordering despite parallel execution
- **Thread Safety**: Comprehensive protection for concurrent access
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded resource usage with automatic cleanup

## Motivation

### The Problem

Machine learning model evaluation often involve processing large datasets where individual samples can be processed independently. Traditional approaches face several challenges:

1. **Fixed Thread Pools**: Standard `ThreadPoolExecutor` uses a fixed number of workers, leading to either:
   - Under-utilization of resources (too few workers)
   - Resource contention and system instability (too many workers)

2. **Resource Blindness**: No awareness of actual system load, leading to:
   - Poor performance when system is already busy
   - Inefficient scaling decisions

### The Solution

`DynamicThreadPoolExecutor` addresses these issues by:

- **Intelligent Scaling**: Starts with minimal workers and scales based on actual resource impact
- **Resource Awareness**: Monitors CPU and GPU utilization to make informed scaling decisions
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Stops immediately on any error, just like sequential execution
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with standard `ThreadPoolExecutor` API

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Sequential Equivalency**: The executor should behave identically to a for loop, except for running in parallel
2. **Resource Respect**: Never overwhelm the system - scale conservatively based on actual impact
3. **Fail-Fast**: Any error should stop all workers immediately, just like sequential execution
4. **Deterministic Behavior**: Same input should produce same output and same error behavior
5. **Performance Focus**: Optimize for common ML workloads with many independent tasks

### Design Patterns

**Impact-Based Scaling**: Measure actual resource impact of each worker before adding more
**Conservative Scaling**: Never scale down, use conservative thresholds to prevent resource exhaustion
**Lock-Protected State**: All shared state protected by locks for thread safety

### Key Components

**DynamicWorker**: Individual worker threads that:
- Process tasks from a shared queue
- Track performance statistics
- Implement fail-fast error handling
- Exit immediately on any error

**Resource Monitor**: Background thread that:
- Tracks system CPU and GPU utilization
- Measures impact of adding new workers
- Makes scaling decisions based on thresholds

**Scaling Engine**: Logic that:
- Analyzes worker impact history
- Estimates resource cost of new workers
- Makes conservative scaling decisions
- Enforces cooldown periods

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Scaling Algorithm

1. **Baseline Measurement**: Before adding a worker, capture current system resources
2. **Worker Addition**: Add new worker and let it start processing tasks
3. **Impact Measurement**: After 2 seconds, measure resource increase
4. **History Tracking**: Store impact measurements (keep last 5)
5. **Scaling Decision**: Use moving average to estimate impact of next worker
6. **Conservative Thresholds**: Only scale if projected usage stays below 80% of limits

### Resource Monitoring

**CPU Monitoring**:
```python
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)  # Non-blocking
```

**GPU Monitoring**:
```python
current_device = torch.cuda.current_device()
gpu_memory_used = torch.cuda.memory_allocated(current_device)
gpu_memory_total = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(current_device).total_memory
gpu_memory_percent = (gpu_memory_used / gpu_memory_total) * 100
```

### Thread Safety

All shared state is protected by a single lock (`self._lock`):
- Worker list management
- Task queue operations
- Resource measurements
- Scaling decisions
- Error state tracking

### Order Preservation

Results maintain original input order despite parallel execution:
1. Tasks submitted with original index
2. Results collected as they complete
3. Sorted by original index before yielding
4. Order maintained even with errors

## Error Handling

### Fail-Fast Philosophy

The executor implements strict fail-fast behavior to match sequential execution:

**Sequential Execution**:
```python
for item in dataset:
    result = process(item)  # Any error stops entire loop
```

**Dynamic Executor**:
```python
with executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process, dataset))  # Any error stops all workers
```

### Error Handling Flow

1. **Worker Error**: Any worker encountering an error immediately:
   - Sets the exception on the future
   - Notifies the executor of failure
   - Exits the worker thread

2. **Executor Response**: On receiving error notification:
   - Sets `_failed` flag to True
   - Stops all other workers immediately
   - Clears task queue to prevent new work
   - Sets `_shutdown` flag to prevent new submissions

3. **User Experience**: 
   - Exception propagated to user code
   - No partial results returned
   - Clear error messages with context

### Error Equivalency

Comprehensive testing ensures that both sequential and parallel execution:
- Raise the same exception types
- Produce identical error messages
- Fail at the same input values
- Provide no partial results on error

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from utils.dynamic_executor import create_dynamic_executor

def process_item(item):
    # Your processing logic
    return item * 2

# Create executor
executor = create_dynamic_executor(max_workers=8)

# Use as context manager
with executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process_item, dataset))
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
executor = DynamicThreadPoolExecutor(
    max_workers=8,              # Maximum workers (default: CPU count)
    min_workers=1,              # Starting workers (default: 1)
    cpu_threshold=85.0,         # CPU usage limit % (default: 85.0)
    gpu_memory_threshold=85.0,  # GPU memory limit % (default: 85.0)
    monitor_interval=2.0,       # Resource check interval (default: 2.0)
    scale_check_interval=1.0    # Scaling decision interval (default: 1.0)
)
```

### Integration with Pylon

**Base Evaluator Integration**:
```python
# In runners/base_evaluator.py
if self.eval_n_jobs == 1:
    # Sequential execution
    for batch_idx, batch_data in enumerate(dataloader):
        result = self._evaluate_single_batch(model, metric, batch_data, batch_idx)
else:
    # Parallel execution with dynamic executor
    executor = create_dynamic_executor(max_workers=self.eval_n_jobs)
    with executor:
        results = list(executor.map(
            functools.partial(self._evaluate_single_batch, model, metric),
            enumerate(dataloader)
        ))
```

### Test Examples

def test_error_equivalency_single_error():
    inputs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # error at x=7
    
    # Sequential execution
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as seq_exc:
        for x in inputs:
            error_function(x)
    
    # Parallel execution
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as par_exc:
        executor = create_dynamic_executor(max_workers=3)
        with executor:
            list(executor.map(error_function, inputs))
    
    # Both should raise identical errors
    assert type(seq_exc.value) == type(par_exc.value)
    assert str(seq_exc.value) == str(par_exc.value)
```

**Resource Management Test**:
```python
def test_memory_usage_patterns():
    initial_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
    
    # Run multiple executor lifecycles
    for _ in range(5):
        executor = DynamicThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)
        futures = [executor.submit(work_function, i) for i in range(20)]
        for future in futures:
            future.result()
        executor.shutdown(wait=True)
        gc.collect()
    
    final_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
    memory_increase = final_memory - initial_memory
    
    # Memory increase should be reasonable (< 50MB)
    assert memory_increase < 50 * 1024 * 1024
```

## Performance Characteristics
