# Dataset Viewer Architecture

## Overview

The Dataset Viewer is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components. This document describes the architecture in detail, including component interactions and data flow.

## Component Diagram

    A[DatasetViewer] --> B[ViewerState]
    A --> C[DatasetManager]
    A --> D[CallbackRegistry]
    A --> E[UI Components]
    
    B --> F[State History]
    B --> G[Event System]
    
    C --> H[Dataset Cache]
    C --> I[Lazy Loading]
    C --> J[Preloading]
    
    D --> K[Callback Groups]
    D --> L[Dependency Management]
    
    E --> M[Controls]
    E --> N[Display]
```

## Data Flow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant UI
    participant Callbacks
    participant State
    participant Dataset
    
    User->>UI: Interact with controls
    UI->>Callbacks: Trigger callback
    Callbacks->>State: Update state
    State->>Dataset: Request data
    Dataset->>State: Return data
    State->>UI: Update display
```

## Component Details

### 1. DatasetViewer

The main application class that coordinates all components:

- Initializes and manages all subsystems
- Creates and configures the Dash application
- Handles high-level application flow

### 2. ViewerState

Manages application state and history:

- Tracks current dataset, index, and settings
- Maintains undo/redo history
- Emits events for state changes
- Validates state updates

### 3. DatasetManager

Handles dataset operations:

- Loads and caches datasets
- Implements lazy loading
- Manages preloading of adjacent items
- Handles dataset transforms

### 4. CallbackRegistry

Manages callback registration and dependencies:

- Provides decorator-based callback registration
- Groups related callbacks
- Manages callback dependencies
- Handles error reporting

### 5. UI Components

Modular components for the user interface:

- Controls (dataset selector, navigation, transforms)
- Display components (2D/3D visualization)
- Layout management
- Responsive design

## State Management

The viewer uses a centralized state management system:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[State Change] --> B[Validation]
    B --> C[History Update]
    C --> D[Event Emission]
    D --> E[UI Update]
```

## Caching System

The dataset caching system implements:

- LRU (Least Recently Used) caching
- Memory usage limits
- Thread-safe operations
- Automatic cache cleanup

## Event System

Events are used for component communication:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Event Source] --> B[Event Bus]
    B --> C[Event Handlers]
    C --> D[State Updates]
    D --> E[UI Updates]
```

## Error Handling

The viewer implements a comprehensive error handling system:

- Custom exceptions for different error types
- Logging at multiple levels
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation

## Performance Considerations

The architecture includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Datasets are loaded on demand
   - Items are cached for quick access
   - Memory usage is monitored and managed

2. **Preloading**
   - Adjacent items are preloaded
   - Background loading for smooth navigation
   - Configurable preload window

3. **Caching**
   - LRU cache with size limits
   - Memory-aware caching
   - Thread-safe operations

4. **UI Optimization**
   - Efficient rendering
   - Debounced updates
   - Virtual scrolling for large datasets

## Security

The architecture includes security considerations:

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated
   - Dataset paths are sanitized
   - Transform parameters are checked

2. **Resource Management**
   - Memory limits for caching
   - File handle management
   - Network request limits

## Testing

The architecture supports comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Component-level testing
   - State management testing
   - Cache system testing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Component interaction testing
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

3. **UI Tests**
   - Component rendering tests
   - User interaction tests
   - Responsive design tests

## Future Considerations

The architecture is designed to be extensible:

1. **Plugin System**
   - Support for custom visualizations
   - Custom transform plugins
   - Dataset type extensions

2. **API Extensions**
   - REST API support
   - WebSocket integration
   - External tool integration

3. **UI Customization**
   - Theme support
   - Layout customization
   - Component replacement
