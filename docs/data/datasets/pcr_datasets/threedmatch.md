# 3DMatch Dataset Family

## Overview

The 3DMatch dataset family consists of real-world RGB-D scans from **91 indoor scenes** designed for point cloud registration evaluation. It provides two complementary benchmarks:

- **3DMatch**: Standard registration benchmark with mixed overlap distribution
- **3DLoMatch**: Low-overlap registration benchmark for challenging scenarios

Both datasets use identical scene splits but different overlap-based filtering strategies.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from data.datasets import ThreeDMatchDataset, ThreeDLoMatchDataset

# Standard 3DMatch dataset (overlap > 0.3)
dataset = ThreeDMatchDataset(
    data_root='./data/datasets/soft_links/threedmatch',
    split='train',
    matching_radius=0.1,
)

# Low-overlap 3DLoMatch dataset (0.1 < overlap ≤ 0.3)
lomatch_dataset = ThreeDLoMatchDataset(
    data_root='./data/datasets/soft_links/threedmatch',
    split='train',
    matching_radius=0.1,
)

print(f"3DMatch train pairs: {len(dataset)}")        # 14,313 pairs
print(f"3DLoMatch train pairs: {len(lomatch_dataset)}")  # 6,225 pairs
```

### Custom Overlap Range
```python
from data.datasets.pcr_datasets.threedmatch_dataset import _ThreeDMatchBaseDataset

# Custom overlap range dataset
custom_dataset = _ThreeDMatchBaseDataset(
    data_root='./data/datasets/soft_links/threedmatch',
    split='train',
    overlap_min=0.5,    # 50% minimum overlap
    overlap_max=0.8,    # 80% maximum overlap
    matching_radius=0.1,
)
```

## Dataset Statistics

### Dataset Sizes Summary

| Dataset | Train | Val | Test | Overlap Filter |
|---------|-------|-----|------|----------------|
| **3DMatch** | 14,313 pairs | 915 pairs | 1,520 pairs | overlap > 0.3 |
| **3DLoMatch** | 6,225 pairs | 414 pairs | 1,772 pairs | 0.1 < overlap ≤ 0.3 |

### Metadata Files Overview

| File | Total Pairs | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **train.pkl** | 20,642 | All training pairs from 75 scenes |
| **val.pkl** | 1,331 | All validation pairs from 8 scenes |
| **3DMatch.pkl** | 1,623 | Pre-curated test pairs (mixed overlap) |
| **3DLoMatch.pkl** | 1,781 | Pre-curated test pairs (low overlap) |

## Dataset Design

### Overlap-Based Partitioning Strategy

**Train/Val Splits**: Perfect overlap-based partitioning
- Source: Same metadata files (`train.pkl`, `val.pkl`)
- Method: Runtime filtering by overlap range
- Result: 0 pairs overlap between 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch

**Test Splits**: Pre-curated evaluation sets
- Source: Different metadata files (`3DMatch.pkl`, `3DLoMatch.pkl`)
- Method: Independent curation with different philosophies
- Result: 103 pairs from 3DMatch.pkl match 3DLoMatch filter (6.8% of 3DMatch filtered pairs)

### Why Test Sets Overlap

The 103 overlapping test pairs exist because:
1. **Independent curation**: Files created separately by different researchers
2. **Boundary cases**: Both include pairs in the 0.1-0.3 overlap range
3. **Evaluation philosophy**: Both wanted challenging borderline cases
4. **Minimal impact**: Only 6.8% overlap doesn't significantly affect evaluation validity

## Scene Splits

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Data Leakage Between Train/Val

**Problem**: Scene `analysis-by-synthesis-apt2-kitchen` appears in BOTH training and validation splits.

**Impact**:
- Scene appears in both train and validation metadata
- May result in data leakage during validation
- Exact pair counts depend on overlap filtering applied
- May inflate validation performance metrics

**Mitigation**:
1. Remove leaked scene from validation (use only 7 clean scenes)
2. Report results both with and without leaked scene
3. Use test set for final evaluation only

            'feat': torch.Tensor,   # Features (M, 1) - all ones
        },
        'tgt_pc': {
            'pos': torch.Tensor,    # Target point cloud (N, 3)
            'feat': torch.Tensor,   # Features (N, 1) - all ones

        'scene_name': str,               # Scene name
        'overlap': float,                # Overlap ratio
        'src_frame': int,                # Source fragment ID
        'tgt_frame': int,                # Target fragment ID

## Implementation Details

### Metadata Format
All `.pkl` files use GeoTransformer format (list of dictionaries):
```python
[
    {
        'pcd0': str,              # Source point cloud path
        'pcd1': str,              # Target point cloud path
        'rotation': np.ndarray,   # (3, 3) rotation matrix
        'translation': np.ndarray,# (3,) translation vector
        'overlap': float,         # Overlap ratio [0, 1]
        'scene_name': str,        # Scene identifier
        'frag_id0': int,          # Source fragment ID
        'frag_id1': int,          # Target fragment ID
    },
    ...
]
```

### Filtering Logic
```python
# Runtime overlap filtering
if self.overlap_min < overlap <= self.overlap_max:
    # Include pair in dataset

# 3DMatch: overlap_min=0.3, overlap_max=1.0
# 3DLoMatch: overlap_min=0.1, overlap_max=0.3
```

### Key Features
- **Correspondence caching**: Computed correspondences cached for performance
- **Thread-safe**: Supports multi-worker DataLoader
- **Device handling**: Automatic GPU/CPU transfer handled by BaseDataset
- **Scene validation**: Ensures source/target from same scene
