## 1. Project Overview

A chat bot that builds deep, layered knowledge from provided sources. Users provide sources (repositories, papers, databases) → the bot builds knowledge through iterative inference → users can then ask anything about those sources.

## 2. Information Sources

### 2.1. Core Architecture: Unified Information Source Model

All information sources implement the same interface to maintain consistency:

#### 2.1.1. Information Source Interface

```
interface InformationSource {
    get_source_type() -> string        // "github_repo", "pdf", "user_interaction"
    extract_information() -> [RawInfo] // Extract all available information
    is_available() -> boolean          // Check if source is ready
}

struct RawInformation {
    content: string           // The actual information content
    type: string             // "file_content", "user_statement", "database_record"
    source_metadata: dict    // Source-specific details (file path, timestamp, etc.)
}
```

### 2.2. Information Source Types

#### 2.2.1. Unified Source Architecture

```
Information Source Types:
  - GitHubRepo: Code repositories (AST parsing, documentation, dependencies)
  - UserInteraction: Confirmations, corrections, chat sessions, and self-validation (bidirectional, verified)
  - PDFDocument: Papers and documents (text, structure, references)
  - Database: Structured data (records, relationships, metadata)
  - KnowledgeBaseSource: Recursive meta-analysis of existing knowledge

GitHubRepo Details:
  Purpose: Extract information from code repositories
  Data Extraction:
    - Parse Python files using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    - Extract README.md and documentation files
    - Analyze requirements.txt for dependencies
    - Identify project structure and organization
  Output: RawInformation with file locations and code elements

UserInteraction Details:
  Purpose: Treat all user interactions and chat sessions as information sources
  
  Components:
    - UserResponse: Stores question-answer pairs with timestamps
    - UserQuestion: Queued questions with knowledge context
    - ChatSession: Complete conversation history as knowledge source
    - SelfValidation: Bot's own hypothesis testing and script outputs
    - Response storage with confidence tracking
    
  Information Types Captured:
    - Direct user confirmations and corrections (explicit knowledge)
    - Chat conversation flow and context (implicit knowledge patterns)
    - Bot self-generated debugging scripts with informative outputs
    - Self-proposed hypotheses and their validation results
    - User expertise demonstrations through detailed explanations
    
  Special Features:
    - Bidirectional interaction (bot asks, user responds)
    - Context preservation (question → response relationships)
    - Automatic confidence = 1.0 (user statements always verified)
    - Self-validation: Bot treats its own validated hypotheses as VERIFIED knowledge
    - Chat mining: Extract implicit knowledge from conversation patterns
    - Integration with curiosity engine for question generation
    
  Self-Learning Examples:
    - Bot generates test script → validates hypothesis → adds result as VERIFIED knowledge
    - Bot proposes architectural insight → tests against codebase → confirms/refutes
    - Bot analyzes its own reasoning chains → improves future inference patterns

KnowledgeBaseSource Details:
  Purpose: Treat existing knowledge base as information source for meta-analysis
  
  Data Extraction Strategy:
    - Pattern Analysis: Identify recurring patterns in existing knowledge
    - Relationship Mining: Find implicit connections between knowledge items  
    - Architectural Inference: Derive system-level insights from component knowledge
    - Abstraction Building: Create higher-level concepts from detailed facts
  
  Extraction Examples:
    Raw Knowledge: [10 function definitions, 5 class definitions, 8 imports]
    → Meta Knowledge: "This module follows object-oriented design patterns"
    
    Raw Knowledge: [error handling in 15 functions, try-catch patterns, logging calls]  
    → Meta Knowledge: "System has comprehensive error handling architecture"

Common Interface:
  - get_source_type() → Source identifier
  - extract_information() → RawInformation list  
  - is_available() → Availability check
```

### 2.3. Information Processing Pipeline

```
Multiple Information Sources → Extract RawInformation → Convert to Knowledge
     ↓                              ↓                        ↓
GitHub Repo                  File contents             Facts about code
PDF Documents               Text + structure          Research findings  
User Interaction            Confirmations             User clarifications
Database Records           Structured data            Domain facts
     ↓                              ↓                        ↓
                    All sources feed into same pipeline
                              ↓
                    Rigorous Inference Engine
                              ↓
                    Enhanced Knowledge Base
                              ↓
                    Ready for Questions
```

#### 2.3.1. Source Processing Examples

```
// All information sources follow same interface (including knowledge base itself):
sources = [
    GitHubRepo("/path/to/repo"),        // Static: files, structure, dependencies
    UserInteraction(),                  // Interactive: confirmations, clarifications  
    PDFDocument("/path/to/paper"),      // Static: text, references, figures
    Database("connection_string"),      // Dynamic: records, relationships
    KnowledgeBaseSource(existing_kb)   // Recursive: knowledge-on-knowledge building
]

// Same processing pipeline for all sources (including recursive):
for each source:
    raw_info = source.extract_information()     // Source-specific extraction
    knowledge = convert_to_knowledge(raw_info)  // Standardize format
    knowledge_base.add(knowledge)               // Store with source tracking
    inference_engine.infer_new_knowledge()     // Build derived knowledge
```

#### 2.3.2. Benefits of This Approach

- **🔄 Extensibility**: Adding new source types is trivial
- **🎯 Consistency**: Same rigorous processing for all information
- **🧠 Simplicity**: No special cases or complex interaction handling  
- **📊 Traceability**: All knowledge clearly shows its source
- **⚡ Scalability**: Unlimited source types with same architecture

## 3. Knowledge Building

### 3.1. Data Structure (Knowledge Representation)

#### 3.1.1. Knowledge Confidence System

```
Knowledge Confidence Levels:
  VERIFIED   - 100% certain from direct evidence (confidence = 1.0)
  DEDUCED    - Logically derived, no assumptions (confidence = 0.95)
  UNKNOWN    - Cannot determine from evidence (confidence = 0.0)
  CONFLICTED - Multiple contradictory sources (confidence = 0.0)

Knowledge Structure:
  {
    content: "Class Parser is defined in parser.py"
    type: "class_definition" 
    source: "github_repo:parser.py:15"
    status: VERIFIED
    evidence: [list of supporting knowledge items]
    confidence: 1.0
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    derivation_chain: ["raw_info_id_123", "inference_rule_2"]
  }

Knowledge Collections:
  - verified_knowledge: High confidence facts from direct evidence
  - deduced_knowledge: Logical inferences with evidence chains
  - unknown_items: Cannot determine from available evidence
  - conflicts: Contradictory information requiring resolution
  - source_tracker: Maps source_type → knowledge items for traceability
```

#### 3.1.2. Conflict Detection and Resolution

```
Conflict Detection Strategy:
  1. Semantic Comparison: 
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content meaning, not just exact string match
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Workflow:
     if no_conflict: 
       → Add to appropriate collection by status
       → Update source tracking metadata
     elif conflict_detected: 
       → Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       → Include all conflicting sources as evidence
       → Mark original conflicting items as superseded
       → Add to conflicts collection for user resolution
     elif supports_existing: 
       → Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
       → Add as supporting evidence
       → Update evidence chain
     
  3. Conflict Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen confidence)
```

### 3.2. Information Processing into Knowledge

#### 3.2.1. Raw Information to Knowledge Conversion

```
Processing Pipeline:
  RawInformation → Knowledge Extraction → Knowledge Validation → Knowledge Storage

Step 1: Raw Information Analysis
  - Parse content based on info_type ("file_content", "user_statement", "database_record")
  - Extract semantic meaning and structural elements
  - Identify knowledge type (class_definition, function_call, user_confirmation, etc.)
  - Preserve source metadata and provenance

Step 2: Knowledge Item Creation
  - Convert parsed content into standardized Knowledge structure
  - Assign initial confidence based on source type:
    * Direct evidence (AST parsing, user statements) → VERIFIED (1.0)
    * Pattern matching and heuristics → DEDUCED (0.95)
    * Incomplete or ambiguous information → UNKNOWN (0.0)
  - Create evidence chain linking back to RawInformation
  - Generate unique knowledge identifier

Step 3: Knowledge Base Integration
  - Check for conflicts with existing knowledge
  - Apply conflict resolution strategy
  - Add to appropriate knowledge collection
  - Update source tracking and cross-references
  - Trigger inference engine for related knowledge discovery
```

#### 3.2.2. Knowledge Base Addition Process

```
knowledge_base.add(new_knowledge):
  
  1. Validation Phase:
     - Verify knowledge structure completeness
     - Validate confidence levels and evidence chains
     - Check source metadata integrity
     
  2. Conflict Detection Phase:
     - Semantic similarity search against existing knowledge
     - Identify potential contradictions or duplicates
     - Cross-reference evidence sources
     
  3. Integration Phase:
     if no_conflicts:
       → Add to appropriate collection (verified/deduced/unknown)
       → Update source_tracker mappings
       → Create cross-reference indices
     elif conflicts_found:
       → Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       → Link all conflicting sources as evidence
       → Mark original items as "under review"
       → Queue for user resolution
     elif supports_existing:
       → Merge evidence with existing knowledge
       → Strengthen confidence if appropriate
       → Update evidence chains
       
  4. Inference Trigger Phase:
     - Notify inference engine of new knowledge
     - Schedule inference runs based on knowledge type
     - Update inference priority queues
```

### 3.3. User Source and Knowledge Validation

#### 3.3.1. Real-Time Validation During Response Generation

```
Knowledge Validation in Chat Flow:

1. Response Generation Phase:
   user: "What does the Parser class do?"
   
   system retrieves knowledge:
     VERIFIED: "Parser class defined in parser.py:15"
     DEDUCED: "Parser processes input data" (confidence: 0.85)
     UNKNOWN: "Parser input format" (insufficient evidence)
   
   response includes validation requests:
     "Based on code analysis:
      ✓ VERIFIED: Parser class is defined in parser.py
      → DEDUCED: Parser appears to process input data (confidence: 85%)
      ❓ I deduced Parser processes input data. Is this correct?"

2. User Validation Response:
   user: "Yes, but specifically it parses XML configuration files"
   
   system processes validation:
     - Mark original deduction as VERIFIED
     - Add new knowledge: "Parser processes XML configuration files" (VERIFIED, 1.0)
     - Update evidence chain: user_interaction → enhanced knowledge
     - Trigger inference on XML-related functionality

3. Immediate Knowledge Integration:
   - New VERIFIED knowledge immediately available
   - Related inferences triggered (XML parsing capabilities, config handling)
   - Next questions can leverage enhanced understanding
```

#### 3.3.2. Validation During Knowledge Building

```
Active Knowledge Building with Validation:

Scenario 1: Uncertain Inference Detection
  system during inference:
    Found pattern: Multiple file operations + error handling
    Potential inference: "System has robust file I/O architecture"
    Confidence assessment: 0.7 (below threshold)
    
  action: Generate validation question
    "I noticed patterns suggesting robust file I/O architecture. Does this match your understanding?"
    
  user response processing:
    positive: Upgrade to VERIFIED knowledge
    negative: Create CONFLICTED item, request correction
    correction: Add user's clarification as new VERIFIED knowledge

Scenario 2: Conflicting Evidence Discovery
  system detects:
    Knowledge A: "Parser handles JSON" (source: import statement)
    Knowledge B: "Parser handles XML" (source: function signature)
    
  action: Create CONFLICTED knowledge + validation request
    "I found conflicting info about Parser format support:
     - JSON (from import statements)
     - XML (from function signatures)
     Which is correct, or does it handle both?"
     
  user response integration:
    - Resolve conflict based on user input
    - Create new VERIFIED knowledge with user clarification
    - Update evidence chains for both original knowledge items

Scenario 3: Knowledge Gap Identification
  system recognizes:
    Functions: parse_config(), validate_format(), process_data()
    Missing: What triggers these functions? What's the input source?
    
  action: Generate clarifying question
    "I see config parsing functions but unclear on the trigger. 
     What initiates the parsing process?"
     
  user response processing:
    - Add new VERIFIED knowledge about system triggers
    - Create new inference opportunities about data flow
    - Update architectural understanding
```

#### 3.3.3. UserInteraction Source Advanced Features

```
Advanced User Source Capabilities:

1. Context-Aware Question Generation:
   - Track conversation history
   - Generate questions that build on previous responses
   - Avoid redundant questions about already confirmed knowledge
   - Prioritize questions that unlock new inference opportunities

2. Incremental Knowledge Building:
   - Each user response immediately integrated into knowledge base
   - New responses trigger inference on related topics
   - Building comprehensive understanding through targeted questions
   - User corrections propagate through entire inference chain

3. Validation Confidence Management:
   - User confirmations: confidence = 1.0 (highest)
   - User corrections: original marked CONFLICTED, new knowledge VERIFIED
   - User uncertainty: maintain lower confidence, seek additional evidence
   - User expertise tracking: weight responses based on demonstrated domain knowledge

4. Bidirectional Learning Loop:
   user response → knowledge validation → enhanced understanding → better questions → more targeted user engagement → deeper knowledge building
```

### 3.4. Continuous Knowledge Building (Expansion/Correction) 

#### 3.4.1. 🎯 **Core Design Innovation: Dynamic Knowledge Evolution**

**Traditional Approach**: Static knowledge base built once, only retrieval during chat  
**Our Revolutionary Approach**: Knowledge base continuously grows and evolves during every interaction

#### 3.4.2. Continuous Expansion Mechanisms

```
1. **Conversational Knowledge Growth**
   Every user interaction potentially adds new knowledge:
   
   user: "What does Parser do?"
   bot: "I deduced Parser handles files. Is this correct?"  
   user: "Yes, specifically XML files"
   → User response becomes new VERIFIED knowledge
   → Triggers inference to build XML-related knowledge
   → Knowledge base expands during conversation
   → Future questions benefit from enhanced understanding

2. **On-Demand Source Processing**
   User points to new information → immediate knowledge building:
   
   user: "Read this PDF and tell me about the methodology"
   system immediately:
   → Processes PDF as new information source
   → Extracts facts, methods, references
   → Runs inference to connect with existing knowledge
   → Knowledge base expands in real-time
   → User gets response based on enhanced knowledge

3. **Recursive Knowledge Building**  
   Knowledge base becomes source for meta-knowledge:
   
   existing knowledge: [10 functions, 5 classes, 8 imports]
   system analyzes patterns:
   → Infers: "This module follows object-oriented design"
   → Knowledge base becomes source for architectural insights
   → Higher-level understanding emerges from existing facts
   → Meta-knowledge enables better responses to design questions

4. **Error-Driven Learning**
   Mistakes become learning opportunities:
   
   bot: "Parser handles JSON files"
   user: "No, it handles XML files"
   system immediately:
   → Marks original knowledge as CONFLICTED
   → Adds user correction as VERIFIED knowledge
   → Updates all related inferences about file formats
   → Propagates correction throughout knowledge network
```

#### 3.4.3. Knowledge Correction and Refinement

```
Correction Propagation System:

1. **Direct Correction Processing**
   user: "The Parser actually handles JSON, not XML"
   
   system response:
   → Locate original knowledge: "Parser handles XML"
   → Mark as CONFLICTED with user evidence
   → Add new VERIFIED knowledge: "Parser handles JSON" 
   → Update confidence: user_correction = 1.0
   → Trace all dependent inferences
   → Update related knowledge about JSON parsing, config formats
   → Re-run inference on updated knowledge network

2. **Cascade Update Mechanism**
   Original: "Parser handles XML" → "System processes XML configs" → "XML validation required"
   Correction: "Parser handles JSON"
   
   cascade updates:
   → "System processes JSON configs" (updated)
   → "JSON validation required" (updated)  
   → "Config format: JSON schema" (new inference)
   → All dependent knowledge automatically updated

3. **Confidence Adjustment**
   correction impact on confidence levels:
   → Corrected knowledge: confidence = 0.0 (CONFLICTED)
   → User-provided knowledge: confidence = 1.0 (VERIFIED)
   → Dependent inferences: recalculated based on new evidence
   → Related patterns: strength adjusted based on correction

4. **Learning from Corrections**
   system tracks correction patterns:
   → Which types of inferences frequently corrected?
   → Which sources tend to need user validation?
   → Adjust inference confidence accordingly
   → Improve future inference accuracy
```

#### 3.4.4. Expansion Through Multiple Trigger Types

```
Knowledge Expansion Triggers:

1. **User Questions** → Knowledge Discovery
   user: "How does authentication work?"
   → System realizes knowledge gap about authentication
   → Searches sources for auth-related code/docs
   → Builds new knowledge about authentication mechanisms
   → Enhances understanding for future auth questions

2. **Source Updates** → Incremental Learning  
   user: "I just updated the README with new installation steps"
   → System re-processes updated README
   → Identifies changes from previous version
   → Adds new knowledge about installation procedures
   → Updates existing knowledge about project setup

3. **Pattern Recognition** → Meta-Learning
   system notices: frequent database operations across modules
   → Triggers inference about data persistence patterns
   → Builds knowledge about system architecture
   → Enables better responses to design questions

4. **Conflict Resolution** → Knowledge Refinement
   conflicting evidence triggers deep analysis:
   → System seeks additional evidence from sources
   → Generates targeted validation questions
   → Builds more nuanced understanding
   → Resolves conflicts through evidence synthesis

5. **Cross-Source Synthesis** → Knowledge Integration
   GitHub repo + user confirmations + PDF documentation:
   → System finds connections between sources
   → Builds unified understanding across information types
   → Creates comprehensive knowledge about topics
   → Enables sophisticated multi-source responses
```

#### 3.4.5. 🔄 **The Continuous Learning Loop**

```
Ongoing Knowledge Evolution:

Initial State: Basic facts from source analysis
     ↓
User Interaction: Questions, confirmations, corrections
     ↓  
Knowledge Expansion: New facts, resolved conflicts, enhanced understanding
     ↓
Improved Responses: Better answers based on growing knowledge
     ↓
More Targeted Questions: System asks smarter validation questions
     ↓
Deeper User Engagement: Users provide richer information
     ↓
Enhanced Knowledge Base: Continuously improving understanding
     ↓
[Loop continues indefinitely - knowledge never stops growing]
```

**This design makes the chat bot a true learning partner, not just a static Q&A system.**

### 3.5. Inference System (BFS, DFS, Rigorous)

#### 3.5.1. Breadth-First Knowledge Building

```
BFS Strategy: Build wide knowledge first, then deep insights

Layer-by-Layer Expansion:
  Layer 0: [Facts from all sources] 
  Layer 1: [All possible inferences from Layer 0]
  Layer 2: [All possible inferences from Layer 1]
...continue until no new knowledge

Flexible Inference Algorithm:
  current_layer = all_facts_and_relationships
  while current_layer has items and depth < MAX_DEPTH:
    next_layer = []
    
    // Try different inference patterns:
    for each knowledge_item k in current_layer:
      // Unary inferences (single item analysis)
      unary_inferences = try_unary_inference(k)
      next_layer.add_all(unary_inferences)
      
      // Binary inferences (pairs)
      for each other_item k2 in current_layer where k2 != k:
        binary_inference = try_binary_inference(k, k2)
        if binary_inference: next_layer.add(binary_inference)
        
        // Triplet inferences (three items needed)
        for each third_item k3 in current_layer where k3 != k and k3 != k2:
          triplet_inference = try_triplet_inference(k, k2, k3)
          if triplet_inference: next_layer.add(triplet_inference)
          
    current_layer = next_layer
    depth++

Inference Pattern Examples:
  Unary:    "function_definition" → "this_is_a_utility_function" (pattern analysis)
  Binary:   "class_def" + "inheritance" → "inheritance_relationship"  
  Triplet:  "import" + "class_def" + "usage" → "external_dependency_pattern"
  N-ary:    Multiple related functions → "module_functionality_pattern"
```

**BFS Result Example:**
```
Layer 0: [function_def(parse), function_def(analyze), class_def(Parser)]
Layer 1: [Parser_uses_parse, Parser_uses_analyze, parse_calls_analyze] 
Layer 2: [Parser_is_main_component, parse_analyze_pipeline_pattern]
Layer 3: [codebase_follows_modular_design]
```

##### 3.5.1.1. **Depth-First Knowledge Building** 
*Follow one reasoning chain as deep as possible before exploring alternatives*

```
DFS Strategy: Pick a domain and infer as deeply as possible

Focus areas: 'architecture', 'data_flow', 'error_handling', etc.

Algorithm:
  stack = [seed_knowledge_for_focus_area]
  while stack not empty and depth < MAX_DEPTH:
    current = stack.pop()
    
    // Try all inference patterns for current knowledge
    best_next = find_strongest_inference_from(current, focus_area)
    // This could be unary, binary, triplet, etc. - whatever fits best
    
    if best_next and not already_known(best_next):
      knowledge_base.add(best_next)  // Add to knowledge base immediately
      stack.push(best_next)          // Continue this reasoning chain

Key Differences from BFS:
  - BFS: Explores broadly across all domains at each layer
  - DFS: Follows deep reasoning chains in specific domain
  - Both strategies add knowledge to knowledge_base immediately when found
  
Knowledge Base Update Pattern (Same for Both):
  - When new knowledge inferred → immediately add to knowledge_base
  - This enables incremental knowledge building during inference
  - No difference in update timing between BFS and DFS
```

**DFS Result Example (focus_area='architecture'):**
```
Chain 1: class_def(FastAPI) → inherits(Starlette) → web_framework_pattern → 
         ASGI_architecture → async_request_handling → high_performance_design

Chain 2: function_def(@app.get) → decorator_pattern → routing_mechanism → 
         RESTful_API_design → HTTP_method_mapping → API_endpoint_architecture
```

##### 3.5.1.2. **Strategy Comparison**

| Aspect | Breadth-First | Depth-First |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | Comprehensive across all domains | Deep in specific domains |
| **Knowledge Type** | Broad understanding | Specialized expertise |
| **Use Case** | General Q&A about entire codebase | Focused analysis (architecture, security, etc.) |
| **Processing Time** | Longer (explores everything) | Faster (focused exploration) |
| **Result Quality** | Well-rounded knowledge | Deep domain insights |

**Strategy Selection Logic:**
```
Strategy Selection:
  if user_intent = "overview" or "general_understanding":
    use breadth_first  // Wide coverage across all domains
  elif user_intent = "architecture_analysis" or "security_review":
    use depth_first    // Deep dive into specific area
  elif source_type = "large_codebase":
    use hybrid         // BFS first, then DFS on key areas
  else:
    use breadth_first  // Default to comprehensive
```

### 3.6. System Components

#### 3.6.1. Knowledge Representation System

```
Knowledge Confidence Levels:
  VERIFIED   - 100% certain from direct evidence (confidence = 1.0)
  DEDUCED    - Logically derived, no assumptions (confidence = 0.95)
  UNKNOWN    - Cannot determine from evidence (confidence = 0.0)
  CONFLICTED - Multiple contradictory sources (confidence = 0.0)

Knowledge Structure:
  {
    content: "Class Parser is defined in parser.py"
    type: "class_definition" 
    source: "github_repo:parser.py:15"
    status: VERIFIED
    evidence: [list of supporting knowledge items]
    confidence: 1.0
  }

Conflict Detection and Resolution:
  1. Conflict Detection:
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content semantically (not just exact match)
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Strategy:
     if no_conflict: Add to appropriate collection by status
     elif conflict_detected: Create CONFLICTED knowledge item with all sources
     elif supports_existing: Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
     
  3. Conflict Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen)
```

#### 3.6.2. Rigorous Inference Engine

```
Purpose: Build new knowledge using rigorous evidence-based inference

Strategy Implementation:
  - Breadth-First: Expand knowledge layer by layer across all domains
  - Depth-First: Follow reasoning chains deep in specific focus areas
  - Hybrid: BFS for broad coverage, then DFS for deep insights

Evidence Requirements:
  - Only rigorous inferences using exact matching
  - Every inference must cite source evidence
  - Proper categorization as VERIFIED/DEDUCED/UNKNOWN/CONFLICTED
  - No guessing or fuzzy matching allowed

Flexible Inference Patterns:
  - Unary: Single knowledge item analysis (e.g., "function_definition" → "utility_function")
  - Binary: Pairs of knowledge items (e.g., "class_def" + "inheritance" → "inheritance_relationship")
  - Triplet: Three items needed (e.g., "import" + "class_def" + "usage" → "dependency_pattern")
  - N-ary: Multiple related items → higher-level patterns

Rigorous Inference Rules (only build knowledge that can be PROVEN):
  Rule 1: Function Usage
    if (k1 = function_definition AND k2 = function_call):
      if exact_name_match(k1.name, k2.name):
        create VERIFIED knowledge: "Function X is called at location Y"

  Rule 2: Class Inheritance  
    if (k1 = class_definition AND k2 = inheritance_declaration):
      if exact_parent_match(k1.name, k2.parent):
        create VERIFIED knowledge: "Class X is base class for Y"

  Rule 3: Import Usage
    if (k1 = import_statement AND k2 = symbol_usage):
      if import_provides_symbol(k1, k2.symbol):
        create VERIFIED knowledge: "Module X is used via symbol Y"

Evidence Standards by Inference Type:
  function_usage: Requires exactly 2 pieces of evidence (function_definition + function_call)
  inheritance_relationship: Must have class_definition + inheritance_declaration  
  dependency_usage: Must have import_statement + symbol_usage
  
Handling Uncertainty:
  - If evidence insufficient → create UNKNOWN knowledge
  - If sources contradict → create CONFLICTED knowledge  
  - If no rigorous rule applies → create nothing (don't guess)
```

#### 3.6.3. Information Processing Flow

**Knowledge Base with Conflict Detection:**

```
KnowledgeBase.add_knowledge(new_knowledge):

  1. Conflict Detection:
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content semantically (not just exact match)
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Strategy:
     if no_conflict:
       - Add to appropriate collection by status
       - Update source tracking
     elif conflict_detected:
       - Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       - Include all conflicting sources as evidence
       - Mark original conflicting items as superseded
       - Add conflict to conflicts collection
     elif supports_existing:
       - Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
       - Add as supporting evidence
       
  3. Knowledge Collections:
     - verified_knowledge: High confidence facts
     - deduced_knowledge: Logical inferences  
     - unknown_items: Cannot determine from evidence
     - conflicts: Contradictory information
     - source_tracker: Maps source_type → knowledge items

  4. Conflict Detection Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen)
```

*Note: Response structure and query processing details are covered in the Query Processing section.*

#### 3.6.4. Unified Information Flow Example

```
User: "What's the purpose of the Parser class?"

Bot: "Based on analysis from multiple sources:
VERIFIED FACTS:
✓ Parser class is defined in parser.py (Source: github_repo)

LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS:
→ Parser appears to process input data (Derived from: 2 sources)

❓ I deduced that Parser appears to process input data. Is this correct?"

User: "Yes, but specifically it parses configuration files"

Bot: [Processes user response as new information source]
"Thank you! I've learned from your response. What else would you like to know?"

User: "How does the Parser work?"

Bot: "VERIFIED FACTS:
✓ Parser class is defined in parser.py (Source: github_repo)
✓ Parser parses configuration files (Source: user_interaction)
..."
```



#### 3.6.5. Core System Components

```
Chat Bot Processing Flow:

1. Input Analysis:
   - New information provided → Process as information source
   - New document referenced → Add source + build knowledge  
   - Question asked → Determine response strategy + build knowledge
   - Confirmation/correction → Update knowledge + trigger inference

2. Knowledge Building Triggers:
   - User confirmations/corrections → Build verified knowledge
   - New documents mentioned → Extract + infer knowledge
   - Knowledge base growth → Trigger meta-analysis
   - Pattern questions → Analyze existing knowledge patterns

3. Response Strategies:
   - Knowledge Base Mode: Query existing knowledge, mark gaps for clarification
   - RAG Mode: Direct source retrieval with potential knowledge building
   - Hybrid Mode: Combine knowledge base + RAG, discover new connections
```

## 4. Chat Bot System

### 4.1. Query Processing

**Response Generation Strategy:**

```
Query Processing Pipeline:
  1. Question Analysis → Determine query type and response strategy
  2. Knowledge Retrieval → Semantic search + keyword matching from knowledge base
  3. Context Building → Rank by relevance and confidence level
  4. Response Generation → LLM prompt with source constraints and uncertainty indicators

Response Format with Confidence Levels:
  ✓ VERIFIED FACTS: Direct evidence from sources
  → LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS: Rigorous inferences with evidence
  ? UNCLEAR AREAS: Insufficient evidence for determination
  ⚠ CONFLICTING INFORMATION: Contradictory sources requiring clarification

Key Constraints:
  - Only use information from provided sources (no external knowledge)
  - Always cite sources and show confidence levels
  - Generate clarification questions for uncertain knowledge
```

## 5. Web Interface

Purpose: Generate confirmation questions during knowledge building and chat

Components:
  - Uncertainty Detector: Identifies knowledge needing confirmation
  - Question Generator: Creates natural language questions
  - Context Tracker: Links questions to knowledge items
  - Confirmation Processor: Updates knowledge from user feedback

Curiosity Triggers (when to ask questions):
  1. Low Confidence Deductions (confidence < 0.8)
  2. Conflicting Information Detected
  3. Pattern Recognition Uncertainty  
  4. Cross-Source Inconsistencies
  5. Missing Critical Information

Active Confirmation Process:
  1. During knowledge building/inference:
     - Check each new knowledge item for uncertainty
     - Generate confirmation question if needed
     - Add to pending confirmations queue
     
  2. During response generation:
     - Identify knowledge used in response
     - Mark uncertain knowledge for potential confirmation
     - Include confirmation requests in response
     
  3. User feedback processing:
     - Positive confirmation → upgrade confidence to VERIFIED
     - Negative confirmation → create CONFLICTED knowledge
     - User corrections → add new VERIFIED knowledge from user input

Question Types:
  - Deductions: "I deduced X from Y. Is this correct?"
  - Conflicts: "Found conflicting info: A vs B. Which is correct?"
  - Patterns: "I noticed pattern X. Does this make sense?"
  - Gaps: "Couldn't determine X from sources. Can you clarify?"
```

**Verbose Knowledge Display Design:**

```
Purpose: Show users exactly which knowledge was used in responses

Knowledge Tracking Strategy:
  - Record which knowledge items retrieved for each response
  - Track confidence levels and original sources
  - Maintain evidence chains showing how knowledge was derived

Display Format:
  - Group by confidence (Verified → Deduced → Uncertain)
  - Color-code by reliability (Green/Yellow/Red)
  - Show source attribution and evidence chains
  - Expandable details for full context

User Correction Flow:
  - User clicks "This understanding is wrong"
  - Correction dialog opens with comment box
  - User input processed as new verified knowledge
  - Knowledge base updated and inferences re-run
```

**Enhanced Chat Architecture:**

```
Active Confirmation Integration:

chat_with_curiosity() method:
  - Process user input for new information
  - Generate response using current knowledge
  - Simultaneously generate confirmation questions
  - Return response + knowledge metadata + confirmations

process_confirmation() method:
  - Locate original knowledge item
  - Update confidence based on user feedback
  - Process corrections as new verified knowledge
  - Trigger inference updates on corrected knowledge

Benefits:
  - Continuous learning during conversation
  - Transparent reasoning builds user trust
  - Active curiosity prevents knowledge gaps
  - User corrections improve future responses
```
