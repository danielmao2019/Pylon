# Part I: System Design

## Key Innovation: Continuous Knowledge Building

### The Dynamic Knowledge Insight

**Traditional chat bots**: Knowledge is static after initialization, only retrieval during chat  
**Our approach**: Knowledge continuously grows during conversation through multiple mechanisms:

1. **User Interaction as Information Source**: Confirmations, clarifications treated as new information
2. **On-Demand Source Processing**: User points to new docs → immediate knowledge building  
3. **Recursive Knowledge Building**: Knowledge base itself becomes source for higher-level knowledge
4. **Conversational Learning**: Every chat interaction potentially adds new knowledge

### Continuous Knowledge Building Scenarios

```
Scenario 1: User Confirmation
  user: "What does Parser do?"
  bot: "I deduced Parser handles files. Is this correct?"  
  user: "Yes, specifically XML files"
  → User response becomes new VERIFIED knowledge
  → Triggers inference to build XML-related knowledge
  → Knowledge base grows during conversation

Scenario 2: User Points to New Document  
  user: "Read this PDF and tell me about the methodology"
  → System immediately processes PDF as new information source
  → Builds knowledge from PDF content
  → Runs inference to connect with existing knowledge
  → Knowledge base expands in real-time

Scenario 3: Knowledge-on-Knowledge Building
  → Existing knowledge base contains facts about functions
  → System analyzes knowledge patterns to infer architectural insights  
  → Knowledge base becomes source for meta-knowledge
  → Higher-level understanding emerges from existing knowledge
```

```
// All information sources follow same interface (including knowledge base itself):
sources = [
    GitHubRepo("/path/to/repo"),        // Static: files, structure, dependencies
    UserInteraction(),                  // Interactive: confirmations, clarifications  
    PDFDocument("/path/to/paper"),      // Static: text, references, figures
    Database("connection_string"),      // Dynamic: records, relationships
    KnowledgeBaseSource(existing_kb)   // Recursive: knowledge-on-knowledge building
]

// Same processing pipeline for all sources (including recursive):
for each source:
    raw_info = source.extract_information()     // Source-specific extraction
    knowledge = convert_to_knowledge(raw_info)  // Standardize format
    knowledge_base.add(knowledge)               // Store with source tracking
    inference_engine.infer_new_knowledge()     // Build derived knowledge
    
// Recursive Knowledge Building:
// The knowledge_base itself can be treated as an information source
// to build higher-level meta-knowledge and architectural insights
```

### Recursive Knowledge Building Design

```
KnowledgeBaseSource Implementation Plan:

Purpose: Treat existing knowledge base as information source for meta-analysis

Data Extraction Strategy:
  - Pattern Analysis: Identify recurring patterns in existing knowledge
  - Relationship Mining: Find implicit connections between knowledge items  
  - Architectural Inference: Derive system-level insights from component knowledge
  - Abstraction Building: Create higher-level concepts from detailed facts

Extraction Examples:
  Raw Knowledge: [10 function definitions, 5 class definitions, 8 imports]
  →
  Meta Knowledge: "This module follows object-oriented design patterns"
  
  Raw Knowledge: [error handling in 15 functions, try-catch patterns, logging calls]  
  →
  Meta Knowledge: "System has comprehensive error handling architecture"

Recursive Trigger Conditions:
  - Knowledge base reaches certain size threshold
  - User asks architectural/pattern questions
  - Periodic meta-analysis runs
  - New domain of knowledge added (trigger cross-domain analysis)
```

### Benefits of This Approach

- **🔄 Extensibility**: Adding new source types is trivial
- **🎯 Consistency**: Same rigorous processing for all information
- **🧠 Simplicity**: No special cases or complex interaction handling  
- **📊 Traceability**: All knowledge clearly shows its source
- **⚡ Scalability**: Unlimited source types with same architecture

### Information Source Equality Examples

| Traditional Approach | Our Unified Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Read GitHub repo → Extract facts | `github_source.extract_information()` |
| Read PDF → Extract content | `pdf_source.extract_information()` |
| Query database → Get records | `database_source.extract_information()` |
| **Special confirmation system** | `user_source.extract_information()` ✨ |

**The key insight**: Whether information comes from a file, database, or user response doesn't matter - it's all just `RawInformation` that gets processed the same way.

## Core Architecture: Unified Information Source Model

### Information Source Interface

All information sources implement the same contract:

```
interface InformationSource {
    get_source_type() -> string        // "github_repo", "pdf", "user_interaction"
    extract_information() -> [RawInfo] // Extract all available information
    is_available() -> boolean          // Check if source is ready
}

struct RawInformation {
    content: string           // The actual information content
    type: string             // "file_content", "user_statement", "database_record"
    source_metadata: dict    // Source-specific details (file path, timestamp, etc.)
}
```

### The Unified Knowledge Building Process

```
Multiple Information Sources → Extract RawInformation → Convert to Knowledge
     ↓                              ↓                        ↓
GitHub Repo                  File contents             Facts about code
PDF Documents               Text + structure          Research findings  
User Interaction            Confirmations             User clarifications
Database Records           Structured data            Domain facts
     ↓                              ↓                        ↓
                    All sources feed into same pipeline
                              ↓
                    Rigorous Inference Engine
                              ↓
                    Enhanced Knowledge Base
                              ↓
                    Ready for Questions
```

## Knowledge Building: Rigorous Evidence-Based Inference

### Knowledge Inference Strategies (BFS/DFS Analogies)

#### 1. **Breadth-First Knowledge Building**
*Explore all immediate inferences at each layer before going deeper*

```
BFS Strategy: Build wide knowledge first, then deep insights

Layer 0: [Facts from all sources] 
Layer 1: [All possible inferences from Layer 0]
Layer 2: [All possible inferences from Layer 1]
...continue until no new knowledge

Flexible Inference Algorithm:
  current_layer = all_facts_and_relationships
  while current_layer has items and depth < MAX_DEPTH:
    next_layer = []
    
    // Try different inference patterns:
    for each knowledge_item k in current_layer:
      // Unary inferences (single item analysis)
      unary_inferences = try_unary_inference(k)
      next_layer.add_all(unary_inferences)
      
      // Binary inferences (pairs)
      for each other_item k2 in current_layer where k2 != k:
        binary_inference = try_binary_inference(k, k2)
        if binary_inference: next_layer.add(binary_inference)
        
        // Triplet inferences (three items needed)
        for each third_item k3 in current_layer where k3 != k and k3 != k2:
          triplet_inference = try_triplet_inference(k, k2, k3)
          if triplet_inference: next_layer.add(triplet_inference)
          
    current_layer = next_layer
    depth++

Inference Pattern Examples:
  Unary:    "function_definition" → "this_is_a_utility_function" (pattern analysis)
  Binary:   "class_def" + "inheritance" → "inheritance_relationship"  
  Triplet:  "import" + "class_def" + "usage" → "external_dependency_pattern"
  N-ary:    Multiple related functions → "module_functionality_pattern"
```

**BFS Result Example:**
```
Layer 0: [function_def(parse), function_def(analyze), class_def(Parser)]
Layer 1: [Parser_uses_parse, Parser_uses_analyze, parse_calls_analyze] 
Layer 2: [Parser_is_main_component, parse_analyze_pipeline_pattern]
Layer 3: [codebase_follows_modular_design]
```

#### 2. **Depth-First Knowledge Building** 
*Follow one reasoning chain as deep as possible before exploring alternatives*

```
DFS Strategy: Pick a domain and infer as deeply as possible

Focus areas: 'architecture', 'data_flow', 'error_handling', etc.

Algorithm:
  stack = [seed_knowledge_for_focus_area]
  while stack not empty and depth < MAX_DEPTH:
    current = stack.pop()
    
    // Try all inference patterns for current knowledge
    best_next = find_strongest_inference_from(current, focus_area)
    // This could be unary, binary, triplet, etc. - whatever fits best
    
    if best_next and not already_known(best_next):
      knowledge_base.add(best_next)  // Add to knowledge base immediately
      stack.push(best_next)          // Continue this reasoning chain

Key Differences from BFS:
  - BFS: Explores broadly across all domains at each layer
  - DFS: Follows deep reasoning chains in specific domain
  - Both strategies add knowledge to knowledge_base immediately when found
  
Knowledge Base Update Pattern (Same for Both):
  - When new knowledge inferred → immediately add to knowledge_base
  - This enables incremental knowledge building during inference
  - No difference in update timing between BFS and DFS
```

**DFS Result Example (focus_area='architecture'):**
```
Chain 1: class_def(FastAPI) → inherits(Starlette) → web_framework_pattern → 
         ASGI_architecture → async_request_handling → high_performance_design

Chain 2: function_def(@app.get) → decorator_pattern → routing_mechanism → 
         RESTful_API_design → HTTP_method_mapping → API_endpoint_architecture
```

#### 3. **Strategy Comparison**

| Aspect | Breadth-First | Depth-First |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | Comprehensive across all domains | Deep in specific domains |
| **Knowledge Type** | Broad understanding | Specialized expertise |
| **Use Case** | General Q&A about entire codebase | Focused analysis (architecture, security, etc.) |
| **Processing Time** | Longer (explores everything) | Faster (focused exploration) |
| **Result Quality** | Well-rounded knowledge | Deep domain insights |

**Strategy Selection Logic:**
```
Strategy Selection:
  if user_intent = "overview" or "general_understanding":
    use breadth_first  // Wide coverage across all domains
  elif user_intent = "architecture_analysis" or "security_review":
    use depth_first    // Deep dive into specific area
  elif source_type = "large_codebase":
    use hybrid         // BFS first, then DFS on key areas
  else:
    use breadth_first  // Default to comprehensive
```

# Part II: Implementation

## System Components

### Knowledge Representation System

#### Knowledge Confidence System

```
Knowledge Status Types:
  VERIFIED   - 100% certain from direct evidence (confidence = 1.0)
  DEDUCED    - Logically derived, no assumptions (confidence = 0.95)
  UNKNOWN    - Cannot determine from evidence (confidence = 0.0)
  CONFLICTED - Multiple contradictory sources (confidence = 0.0)

Knowledge Structure:
  {
    content: "Class Parser is defined in parser.py"
    type: "class_definition" 
    source: "github_repo:parser.py:15"
    status: VERIFIED
    evidence: [list of supporting knowledge items]
    confidence: 1.0
  }
```

#### Rigorous Inference Rules

```
Inference Rules (only build knowledge that can be PROVEN):

Rule 1: Function Usage
  if (k1 = function_definition AND k2 = function_call):
    if exact_name_match(k1.name, k2.name):
      create VERIFIED knowledge: "Function X is called at location Y"

Rule 2: Class Inheritance  
  if (k1 = class_definition AND k2 = inheritance_declaration):
    if exact_parent_match(k1.name, k2.parent):
      create VERIFIED knowledge: "Class X is base class for Y"

Rule 3: Import Usage
  if (k1 = import_statement AND k2 = symbol_usage):
    if import_provides_symbol(k1, k2.symbol):
      create VERIFIED knowledge: "Module X is used via symbol Y"

Handling Uncertainty:
  - If evidence insufficient → create UNKNOWN knowledge
  - If sources contradict → create CONFLICTED knowledge  
  - If no rigorous rule applies → create nothing (don't guess)
```

#### Rigorous Evidence Standards

```
Evidence Requirements by Inference Type:

function_usage:
  - Requires exactly 2 pieces of evidence
  - Must have function_definition + function_call  
  - Names must match exactly (no fuzzy matching)
  - Both must have valid location information

inheritance_relationship:
  - Requires exactly 2 pieces of evidence
  - Must have class_definition + inheritance_declaration
  - Parent class name must match exactly
  - Must use explicit "class Child(Parent):" syntax

dependency_usage:
  - Requires exactly 2 pieces of evidence  
  - Must have import_statement + symbol_usage
  - Import must actually provide the used symbol
  - No inferring imports from usage alone

General Rules:
  - Unknown inference types → not rigorous (return false)
  - Missing required evidence → not rigorous
  - Fuzzy/approximate matches → not rigorous
```

### Information Processing Flow

**Knowledge Base with Conflict Detection:**

```
KnowledgeBase.add_knowledge(new_knowledge):

  1. Conflict Detection:
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content semantically (not just exact match)
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Strategy:
     if no_conflict:
       - Add to appropriate collection by status
       - Update source tracking
     elif conflict_detected:
       - Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       - Include all conflicting sources as evidence
       - Mark original conflicting items as superseded
       - Add conflict to conflicts collection
     elif supports_existing:
       - Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
       - Add as supporting evidence
       
  3. Knowledge Collections:
     - verified_knowledge: High confidence facts
     - deduced_knowledge: Logical inferences  
     - unknown_items: Cannot determine from evidence
     - conflicts: Contradictory information
     - source_tracker: Maps source_type → knowledge items

  4. Conflict Detection Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen)
```

*Note: Response structure and query processing details are covered in the Query Processing section.*

### Unified Information Flow Example

```
User: "What's the purpose of the Parser class?"

Bot: "Based on analysis from multiple sources:
VERIFIED FACTS:
✓ Parser class is defined in parser.py (Source: github_repo)

LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS:
→ Parser appears to process input data (Derived from: 2 sources)

❓ I deduced that Parser appears to process input data. Is this correct?"

User: "Yes, but specifically it parses configuration files"

Bot: [Processes user response as new information source]
"Thank you! I've learned from your response. What else would you like to know?"

User: "How does the Parser work?"

Bot: "VERIFIED FACTS:
✓ Parser class is defined in parser.py (Source: github_repo)
✓ Parser parses configuration files (Source: user_interaction)
..."
```

## System Architecture

### Unified Information Source Model

The chat bot treats all information equally, whether from:
- **Static sources**: GitHub repos, PDFs, databases, web pages
- **Interactive sources**: User confirmations, clarifications, corrections

```python
class InformationSource(ABC):
    """Abstract base for all information sources"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_source_type(self) -> str:
        """Return source type: 'github_repo', 'pdf', 'database', 'user_interaction'"""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def extract_information(self) -> List[RawInformation]:
        """Extract raw information from this source"""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def is_available(self) -> bool:
        """Check if source is ready to provide information"""
        pass

class RawInformation:
    """Single piece of raw information from any source"""
    def __init__(self, content: str, info_type: str, source_metadata: Dict):
        self.content = content
        self.info_type = info_type  # 'file_content', 'user_statement', 'database_record'
        self.source_metadata = source_metadata  # source-specific details
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
```

### Information Source Types

**Source Implementation Plans:**

```
GitHubRepoSource:
  Purpose: Extract information from code repositories
  Data Extraction:
    - Parse Python/Java/etc. files using AST parsers
    - Extract README.md, documentation files
    - Parse requirements.txt, package.json for dependencies
    - Identify project structure and organization
  Output: RawInformation with file locations and code elements

UserInteractionSource:
  Purpose: Treat user responses as information source
  Data Management:
    - Queue system for pending questions to user
    - Storage for user responses with question context
    - Convert user statements to RawInformation format
  Special Features:
    - Bidirectional interaction (bot asks, user responds)
    - Context preservation (what question led to response)
    - Confidence = 1.0 (user statements are always verified)

PDFSource:
  Purpose: Extract information from PDF documents  
  Data Extraction:
    - Text extraction with layout preservation
    - Table and figure identification
    - Reference and citation parsing
    - Section structure analysis
  Output: RawInformation with page numbers and document structure

DatabaseSource:
  Purpose: Query structured databases for information
  Data Access:
    - SQL query generation based on schema analysis
    - Record retrieval with relationship mapping
    - Metadata extraction (constraints, relationships)
  Output: RawInformation with database provenance

Source Extension Strategy:
  - All sources implement same InformationSource interface
  - Adding new source type = implement 3 methods:
    * get_source_type() → string identifier
    * extract_information() → list of RawInformation
    * is_available() → boolean availability check
```

### Core Components

```
Continuous Knowledge Building Chat Bot Architecture:

ChatBot Processing Flow:

1. Input Analysis:
   - Is user providing new information? → Process as new information source
   - Is user pointing to new document? → Add document source + build knowledge  
   - Is user asking question? → Determine response strategy + potentially build new knowledge
   - Is user confirming/correcting? → Update knowledge + trigger inference

2. Continuous Knowledge Building Triggers:
   - User confirmation/correction → Add to UserInteractionSource → Infer
   - User mentions new document → Create new source → Extract + Infer  
   - Knowledge base size threshold → Trigger recursive analysis → Meta-knowledge
   - Pattern questions → Analyze existing patterns → Derive insights

3. Response Strategy (with knowledge building):
   Knowledge Base Mode:
     - Query existing knowledge
     - If gaps found → mark for user clarification (builds future knowledge)
     
   RAG Mode:  
     - Direct source retrieval
     - Extract relevant content → potentially add to knowledge base
     
   Hybrid Mode:
     - Combine knowledge base + RAG
     - New connections discovered → add to knowledge base

4. Dynamic Implementation:
   chat(user_input):
     // First: Check if this builds knowledge
     new_sources = detect_new_information_sources(user_input)
     for source in new_sources:
       build_knowledge_from_source(source)  // Continuous building
       
     // Then: Generate response  
     strategy = determine_response_strategy(user_input)
     response = generate_response(strategy, user_input)
     
     // Finally: Learn from interaction
     interaction_knowledge = extract_interaction_knowledge(user_input, response)  
     if interaction_knowledge:
       knowledge_base.add(interaction_knowledge)
       
Examples of Continuous Building:
  "Read doc.pdf and explain the methodology" 
    → Add PDFSource(doc.pdf) → Build knowledge → Answer with new knowledge
    
  "The Parser actually handles JSON, not XML"
    → Update knowledge with user correction → Trigger inference on JSON handling
    
  "What patterns do you see in this codebase?"  
    → Trigger recursive analysis → Build meta-knowledge → Answer with insights
```

### Knowledge Representation

*Note: The complete Knowledge and KnowledgeBase implementations with rigorous confidence system are defined in the "Rigorous Knowledge Building Design" section above.*

Key features of the knowledge representation:
- **Knowledge Status System**: VERIFIED, DEDUCED, UNKNOWN, CONFLICTED
- **Evidence Tracking**: Each knowledge item tracks its derivation sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Automatic confidence assignment based on status
- **User Confirmation**: Knowledge can be upgraded to VERIFIED via user input

### Inference Engine

*Note: The rigorous inference implementation is defined as `RigorousInferenceEngine` in the "Rigorous Knowledge Building Design" section above.*

The inference engine implements both BFS and DFS strategies with rigorous evidence requirements:

```python
class InferenceEngine(RigorousInferenceEngine):
    """Builds new knowledge using rigorous evidence-based inference"""
    
    def expand(self, initial_knowledge: KnowledgeBase, 
               strategy: str = "breadth_first") -> KnowledgeBase:
        """Expand knowledge through rigorous inference with BFS/DFS strategies"""
        
        if strategy == "breadth_first":
            return breadth_first_inference(initial_knowledge)
        elif strategy == "depth_first":
            return depth_first_inference(initial_knowledge, focus_area="general")
        else:
            # Hybrid: BFS first for broad coverage, then DFS for deep insights
            broad_knowledge = breadth_first_inference(initial_knowledge)
            return depth_first_inference(broad_knowledge, focus_area="architecture")
```

Key principles:
- **Only rigorous inferences**: Uses exact matching, no guessing
- **Evidence tracking**: Every inference cites its source evidence  
- **Status management**: Properly categorizes as VERIFIED, DEDUCED, UNKNOWN, or CONFLICTED
- **Strategy support**: Both breadth-first and depth-first knowledge building

## Information Source Implementations

### GitHub Repository Source

```python
class GitHubRepoSource(InformationSource):
    """Extract information from GitHub repositories"""
    
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str):
        self.repo_path = repo_path
        
    def get_source_type(self) -> str:
        return 'github_repo'
        
    def is_available(self) -> bool:
        return os.path.exists(self.repo_path)
        
    def extract_information(self) -> List[RawInformation]:
        """Extract all information from repository"""
        raw_info = []
        
        # Extract repository structure
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.repo_path):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith('.py'):
                    file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                    file_info = self._parse_python_file(file_path)
                    raw_info.extend(file_info)
                    
        # Extract documentation
        readme_path = os.path.join(self.repo_path, 'README.md')
        if os.path.exists(readme_path):
            raw_info.extend(self._parse_readme(readme_path))
            
        # Extract dependencies
        requirements_path = os.path.join(self.repo_path, 'requirements.txt')
        if os.path.exists(requirements_path):
            raw_info.extend(self._parse_requirements(requirements_path))
            
        return raw_info
        
    def _parse_python_file(self, file_path: str) -> List[RawInformation]:
        """Parse a Python file into raw information"""
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            
        tree = ast.parse(content)
        raw_info = []
        
        for node in ast.walk(tree):
            if isinstance(node, ast.ClassDef):
                raw_info.append(RawInformation(
                    content=f"Class {node.name} defined",
                    info_type='class_definition',
                    source_metadata={
                        'location': f"{file_path}:{node.lineno}",
                        'class_name': node.name,
                        'file_path': file_path
                    }

# Part II (continued): Query Processing

## Response Strategy Framework

**Query Processing Implementation Plan:**

```
QueryEngine Purpose: Convert user questions into responses using knowledge base

Components:
  - LLM Interface: GPT-4 or local model for text generation
  - Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic similarity
  - Knowledge Retrieval: Vector search + keyword matching
  - Response Generation: Prompt engineering with source constraints

Query Processing Pipeline:
  1. Question Analysis:
     - Determine query type (conceptual vs specific)
     - Choose strategy (knowledge_base vs RAG vs hybrid)
     
  2. Knowledge Retrieval:
     - Semantic search using embeddings
     - Keyword matching for exact terms
     - Retrieve from appropriate knowledge collections (verified, deduced, etc.)
     
  3. Context Building:
     - Rank retrieved knowledge by relevance
     - Organize by confidence level (verified → deduced → unknown)
     - Include source citations
     
  4. Response Generation:
     - Build LLM prompt with retrieved context
     - Enforce source-only constraint (no external knowledge)
     - Generate response with uncertainty indicators
     - Return QueryResult with confidence levels
```

## Query Result Structure

**Response Format with Uncertainty Handling:**

```
QueryResult Data Structure:
  - verified_facts: 100% certain knowledge
  - deduced_facts: Logically sound inferences  
  - unknown_areas: Cannot determine from evidence
  - conflicts: Contradictory information

Response Generation Strategy:
  1. Check for uncertain knowledge (unknown/conflicts/deductions)
  2. If uncertain knowledge exists: generate clarification question
  3. Format response with clear confidence indicators:
     "✓ VERIFIED FACTS: ..." 
     "→ LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS: ..."
     "? UNCLEAR AREAS: ..."
     "⚠ CONFLICTING INFORMATION: ..."

Uncertainty Priority for User Questions:
  1. Conflicts (highest priority - contradictory sources)
  2. Unknown areas (missing information)  
  3. Deductions (can be confirmed by user)

Response Format Strategy:
  - Always cite sources ("Based on github_repo and user_interaction...")
  - Clearly indicate confidence levels (✓ → ? ⚠)
  - Ask clarifying questions when uncertain knowledge found
  - Never hallucinate or use external knowledge
```

## Usage & Examples

```
User Workflow with Unified Sources:

1. Setup:
   bot = KnowledgeChatBot()
   bot.add_github_repo("/path/to/repo")    // Add static source
   bot.add_pdf("/path/to/paper.pdf")       // Add static source
   // User interaction source created automatically

2. Interactive Learning:
   user: "What is the architecture of this project?"
   bot: "Based on code analysis: [response] 
        ❓ I deduced X. Is this correct?"
   
   user: "Yes, but specifically it uses microservices"
   bot: [processes user response as new information source]
        "Thank you! I've learned from your response."
   
   user: "How does authentication work?"
   bot: "Based on github_repo and user_interaction sources: [enhanced response]"

3. Source Equality Demonstration:
   knowledge_by_source = {
     'github_repo': [facts from code analysis],
     'user_interaction': [facts from user responses],
     'pdf_document': [facts from paper content]
   }
   // All sources processed identically through same pipeline
```

### Information Source Equality

**Key insight**: All sources are just different ways to get information:

```
Information Extraction (all sources equal):
  GitHubRepo.extract()     → RawInformation about code
  UserInteraction.extract() → RawInformation about clarifications  
  PDFDocument.extract()    → RawInformation about research
  Database.extract()       → RawInformation about records
  
Processing Pipeline (identical for all):
  RawInformation → Knowledge → Inference → Enhanced Knowledge
```

### Detailed Knowledge Building Examples

### Example: Understanding FastAPI Repository

#### Initial Facts (Direct Extraction)
```
- Class FastAPI defined in main.py:15
- Function get() defined in routing.py:45
- Function post() defined in routing.py:67
- FastAPI inherits from Starlette
- Import statement: from pydantic import BaseModel
```

#### First-Level Inferences
```
- FastAPI is a web framework (from inheritance + HTTP method functions)
- Project uses Pydantic for data validation (from imports + usage patterns)
- Decorator pattern used for routing (from @app.get decorator analysis)
```

#### Deep Inferences (Multi-Level)
```
- FastAPI emphasizes type safety (Pydantic integration + type hints usage)
- Architecture follows dependency injection pattern (from decorator analysis + parameter inspection)
- Framework designed for API development with automatic documentation (OpenAPI integration detected)
```

### Knowledge Evolution Flow

```
Source Code → AST Parse → Extract Classes/Functions → Identify Patterns
                                    ↓
                            Build Relationships (imports, inheritance)
                                    ↓
                            Infer Purpose (web framework, API, etc.)
                                    ↓
                        Infer Design Philosophy (type safety, modern Python)
                                    ↓
                    Deep Architectural Understanding (DI, auto-docs, etc.)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Unified Information Sources**: User interaction treated as information source, not special system - enables clean, extensible architecture

2. **Rigorous Inference Only**: System never guesses - builds knowledge only from provable evidence, creates UNKNOWN/CONFLICTED states for uncertainty

3. **Source Equality**: All information (files, user responses, databases) processed through identical pipeline - no special cases

4. **Iterative Knowledge Building**: System actively builds new knowledge through BFS/DFS inference strategies, not just storage

5. **Transparent Provenance**: Every piece of knowledge tracked to its source with confidence levels - users see reasoning chain

## Future Extensions

### Additional Source Types
- **PDF Papers**: Academic paper parsing with equation extraction
- **Databases**: Structured data with schema understanding
- **APIs**: Live data integration with endpoint discovery
- **Documentation Sites**: Web scraping with content understanding

### Advanced Inference
- **Cross-Source Synthesis**: Finding connections between different sources
- **Temporal Knowledge**: Understanding how knowledge evolves over time
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence levels for inferred knowledge
- **Knowledge Validation**: Consistency checking across sources

This design creates a true learning system that builds understanding layer by layer, exactly as envisioned!
