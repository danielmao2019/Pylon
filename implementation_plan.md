## 1. Project Overview

A chat bot that builds deep, layered knowledge from provided sources. Users provide sources (repositories, papers, databases) → the bot builds knowledge through iterative inference → users can then ask anything about those sources.

### 1.1. Project Naming

**Repository Name**: `nexus`  
**Product Name**: `Nexus`

#### 1.1.1. Symbolic Connection to Pylon

The name **Nexus** perfectly complements the existing **Pylon** framework, drawing from the same StarCraft II protoss civilization:

**Pylon** (Deep Learning Framework):
- Provides foundational power infrastructure for AI research
- Enables other components to operate effectively  
- Creates essential foundation for computer vision tasks
- Powers the underlying computational framework

**Nexus** (Knowledge Chat Bot):
- Serves as the central intelligence hub that coordinates understanding
- Processes and synthesizes information from all knowledge sources
- Makes strategic decisions about inference and learning
- Where all knowledge flows converge to create deep understanding

#### 1.1.2. The Perfect Technological Symbiosis

Just as in StarCraft II where you need **both** Pylon and Nexus working together:
- **Pylon** provides the computational power and research infrastructure
- **Nexus** provides the knowledge intelligence and strategic understanding

This creates a complete research ecosystem where:
- Pylon handles the complex tensor operations, training loops, and computer vision algorithms
- Nexus handles the knowledge extraction, inference, and intelligent question-answering about research

#### 1.1.3. Symbolic Meaning

**The Nexus** represents:
- **Central Intelligence Hub**: Where all information sources converge into unified understanding
- **Strategic Command**: Makes intelligent decisions about knowledge building and inference
- **Knowledge Coordination**: Orchestrates the flow from raw information to deep insights  
- **Wisdom Generation**: Transforms scattered data into actionable knowledge

The name captures the essence of turning multiple information sources into a single, intelligent knowledge system that can provide strategic insights and deep understanding.

## 2. Information Sources

### 2.1. Core Architecture: Unified Information Source Model

All information sources implement the same interface to maintain consistency:

#### 2.1.1. Information Source Interface

```
interface InformationSource {
    get_source_type() -> string        // "github_repo", "pdf", "user_interaction"
    extract_information() -> [RawInfo] // Extract all available information
    is_available() -> boolean          // Check if source is ready
}

struct RawInformation {
    content: string           // The actual information content
    type: string             // "file_content", "user_statement", "database_record"
    source_metadata: dict    // Source-specific details (file path, timestamp, etc.)
}
```

### 2.2. Information Source Types

#### 2.2.1. Unified Source Architecture

```
Information Source Types:
  - GitHubRepo: Code repositories (AST parsing, documentation, dependencies)
  - UserInteraction: Confirmations, corrections, chat sessions, and self-validation (bidirectional, verified)
  - PDFDocument: Papers and documents (text, structure, references)
  - Database: Structured data (records, relationships, metadata)
  - KnowledgeBaseSource: Recursive meta-analysis of existing knowledge

GitHubRepo Details:
  Purpose: Extract information from code repositories
  Data Extraction:
    - Parse Python files using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    - Extract README.md and documentation files
    - Analyze requirements.txt for dependencies
    - Identify project structure and organization
  Output: RawInformation with file locations and code elements

UserInteraction Details:
  Purpose: Treat all user interactions and chat sessions as information sources
  
  Components:
    - UserResponse: Stores question-answer pairs with timestamps
    - UserQuestion: Queued questions with knowledge context
    - ChatSession: Complete conversation history as knowledge source
    - SelfValidation: Bot's own hypothesis testing and script outputs
    - Response storage with confidence tracking
    
  Information Types Captured:
    - Direct user confirmations and corrections (explicit knowledge)
    - Chat conversation flow and context (implicit knowledge patterns)
    - Bot self-generated debugging scripts with informative outputs
    - Self-proposed hypotheses and their validation results
    - User expertise demonstrations through detailed explanations
    
  Special Features:
    - Bidirectional interaction (bot asks, user responds)
    - Context preservation (question → response relationships)
    - Automatic confidence = 1.0 (user statements always verified)
    - Self-validation: Bot treats its own validated hypotheses as VERIFIED knowledge
    - Chat mining: Extract implicit knowledge from conversation patterns
    - Integration with curiosity engine for question generation
    
  Self-Learning Examples:
    - Bot generates test script → validates hypothesis → adds result as VERIFIED knowledge
    - Bot proposes architectural insight → tests against codebase → confirms/refutes
    - Bot analyzes its own reasoning chains → improves future inference patterns

KnowledgeBaseSource Details:
  Purpose: Treat existing knowledge base as information source for meta-analysis
  
  Data Extraction Strategy:
    - Pattern Analysis: Identify recurring patterns in existing knowledge
    - Relationship Mining: Find implicit connections between knowledge items  
    - Architectural Inference: Derive system-level insights from component knowledge
    - Abstraction Building: Create higher-level concepts from detailed facts
  
  Extraction Examples:
    Raw Knowledge: [10 function definitions, 5 class definitions, 8 imports]
    → Meta Knowledge: "This module follows object-oriented design patterns"
    
    Raw Knowledge: [error handling in 15 functions, try-catch patterns, logging calls]  
    → Meta Knowledge: "System has comprehensive error handling architecture"

Common Interface:
  - get_source_type() → Source identifier
  - extract_information() → RawInformation list  
  - is_available() → Availability check
```

### 2.3. Information Processing Pipeline

```
Multiple Information Sources → Extract RawInformation → Convert to Knowledge
     ↓                              ↓                        ↓
GitHub Repo                  File contents             Facts about code
PDF Documents               Text + structure          Research findings  
User Interaction            Confirmations             User clarifications
Database Records           Structured data            Domain facts
     ↓                              ↓                        ↓
                    All sources feed into same pipeline
                              ↓
                    Rigorous Inference Engine
                              ↓
                    Enhanced Knowledge Base
                              ↓
                    Ready for Questions
```

#### 2.3.1. Source Processing Examples

```
// All information sources follow same interface (including knowledge base itself):
sources = [
    GitHubRepo("/path/to/repo"),        // Static: files, structure, dependencies
    UserInteraction(),                  // Interactive: confirmations, clarifications  
    PDFDocument("/path/to/paper"),      // Static: text, references, figures
    Database("connection_string"),      // Dynamic: records, relationships
    KnowledgeBaseSource(existing_kb)   // Recursive: knowledge-on-knowledge building
]

// Same processing pipeline for all sources (including recursive):
for each source:
    raw_info = source.extract_information()     // Source-specific extraction
    knowledge = convert_to_knowledge(raw_info)  // Standardize format
    knowledge_base.add(knowledge)               // Store with source tracking
    inference_engine.infer_new_knowledge()     // Build derived knowledge
```

#### 2.3.2. Benefits of This Approach

- **🔄 Extensibility**: Adding new source types is trivial
- **🎯 Consistency**: Same rigorous processing for all information
- **🧠 Simplicity**: No special cases or complex interaction handling  
- **📊 Traceability**: All knowledge clearly shows its source
- **⚡ Scalability**: Unlimited source types with same architecture

## 3. Knowledge Building

### 3.1. Data Structure (Knowledge Representation)

#### 3.1.1. Knowledge Confidence System

```
Knowledge Confidence Levels:
  VERIFIED   - 100% certain from direct evidence (confidence = 1.0)
  DEDUCED    - Logically derived, no assumptions (confidence = 0.95)
  UNKNOWN    - Cannot determine from evidence (confidence = 0.0)
  CONFLICTED - Multiple contradictory sources (confidence = 0.0)

Knowledge Structure:
  {
    content: "Class Parser is defined in parser.py"
    type: "class_definition" 
    source: "github_repo:parser.py:15"
    status: VERIFIED
    evidence: [list of supporting knowledge items]
    confidence: 1.0
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    derivation_chain: ["raw_info_id_123", "inference_rule_2"]
  }

Knowledge Collections:
  - verified_knowledge: High confidence facts from direct evidence
  - deduced_knowledge: Logical inferences with evidence chains
  - unknown_items: Cannot determine from available evidence
  - conflicts: Contradictory information requiring resolution
  - source_tracker: Maps source_type → knowledge items for traceability
```

#### 3.1.2. Conflict Detection and Resolution

```
Conflict Detection Strategy:
  1. Semantic Comparison: 
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content meaning, not just exact string match
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Workflow:
     if no_conflict: 
       → Add to appropriate collection by status
       → Update source tracking metadata
     elif conflict_detected: 
       → Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       → Include all conflicting sources as evidence
       → Mark original conflicting items as superseded
       → Add to conflicts collection for user resolution
     elif supports_existing: 
       → Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
       → Add as supporting evidence
       → Update evidence chain
     
  3. Conflict Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen confidence)
```

### 3.2. Information Processing into Knowledge

#### 3.2.1. Raw Information to Knowledge Conversion

```
Processing Pipeline:
  RawInformation → Knowledge Extraction → Knowledge Validation → Knowledge Storage

Step 1: Raw Information Analysis
  - Parse content based on info_type ("file_content", "user_statement", "database_record")
  - Extract semantic meaning and structural elements
  - Identify knowledge type (class_definition, function_call, user_confirmation, etc.)
  - Preserve source metadata and provenance

Step 2: Knowledge Item Creation
  - Convert parsed content into standardized Knowledge structure
  - Assign initial confidence based on source type:
    * Direct evidence (AST parsing, user statements) → VERIFIED (1.0)
    * Pattern matching and heuristics → DEDUCED (0.95)
    * Incomplete or ambiguous information → UNKNOWN (0.0)
  - Create evidence chain linking back to RawInformation
  - Generate unique knowledge identifier

Step 3: Knowledge Base Integration
  - Check for conflicts with existing knowledge
  - Apply conflict resolution strategy
  - Add to appropriate knowledge collection
  - Update source tracking and cross-references
  - Trigger inference engine for related knowledge discovery
```

#### 3.2.2. Knowledge Base Addition Process

```
knowledge_base.add(new_knowledge):
  
  1. Validation Phase:
     - Verify knowledge structure completeness
     - Validate confidence levels and evidence chains
     - Check source metadata integrity
     
  2. Conflict Detection Phase:
     - Semantic similarity search against existing knowledge
     - Identify potential contradictions or duplicates
     - Cross-reference evidence sources
     
  3. Integration Phase:
     if no_conflicts:
       → Add to appropriate collection (verified/deduced/unknown)
       → Update source_tracker mappings
       → Create cross-reference indices
     elif conflicts_found:
       → Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       → Link all conflicting sources as evidence
       → Mark original items as "under review"
       → Queue for user resolution
     elif supports_existing:
       → Merge evidence with existing knowledge
       → Strengthen confidence if appropriate
       → Update evidence chains
       
  4. Inference Trigger Phase:
     - Notify inference engine of new knowledge
     - Schedule inference runs based on knowledge type
     - Update inference priority queues
```

### 3.3. User Source and Knowledge Validation

#### 3.3.1. Real-Time Validation During Response Generation

```
Knowledge Validation in Chat Flow:

1. Response Generation Phase:
   user: "What does the Parser class do?"
   
   system retrieves knowledge:
     VERIFIED: "Parser class defined in parser.py:15"
     DEDUCED: "Parser processes input data" (confidence: 0.85)
     UNKNOWN: "Parser input format" (insufficient evidence)
   
   response includes validation requests:
     "Based on code analysis:
      ✓ VERIFIED: Parser class is defined in parser.py
      → DEDUCED: Parser appears to process input data (confidence: 85%)
      ❓ I deduced Parser processes input data. Is this correct?"

2. User Validation Response:
   user: "Yes, but specifically it parses XML configuration files"
   
   system processes validation:
     - Mark original deduction as VERIFIED
     - Add new knowledge: "Parser processes XML configuration files" (VERIFIED, 1.0)
     - Update evidence chain: user_interaction → enhanced knowledge
     - Trigger inference on XML-related functionality

3. Immediate Knowledge Integration:
   - New VERIFIED knowledge immediately available
   - Related inferences triggered (XML parsing capabilities, config handling)
   - Next questions can leverage enhanced understanding
```

#### 3.3.2. Validation During Knowledge Building

```
Active Knowledge Building with Validation:

Scenario 1: Uncertain Inference Detection
  system during inference:
    Found pattern: Multiple file operations + error handling
    Potential inference: "System has robust file I/O architecture"
    Confidence assessment: 0.7 (below threshold)
    
  action: Generate validation question
    "I noticed patterns suggesting robust file I/O architecture. Does this match your understanding?"
    
  user response processing:
    positive: Upgrade to VERIFIED knowledge
    negative: Create CONFLICTED item, request correction
    correction: Add user's clarification as new VERIFIED knowledge

Scenario 2: Conflicting Evidence Discovery
  system detects:
    Knowledge A: "Parser handles JSON" (source: import statement)
    Knowledge B: "Parser handles XML" (source: function signature)
    
  action: Create CONFLICTED knowledge + validation request
    "I found conflicting info about Parser format support:
     - JSON (from import statements)
     - XML (from function signatures)
     Which is correct, or does it handle both?"
     
  user response integration:
    - Resolve conflict based on user input
    - Create new VERIFIED knowledge with user clarification
    - Update evidence chains for both original knowledge items

Scenario 3: Knowledge Gap Identification
  system recognizes:
    Functions: parse_config(), validate_format(), process_data()
    Missing: What triggers these functions? What's the input source?
    
  action: Generate clarifying question
    "I see config parsing functions but unclear on the trigger. 
     What initiates the parsing process?"
     
  user response processing:
    - Add new VERIFIED knowledge about system triggers
    - Create new inference opportunities about data flow
    - Update architectural understanding
```

#### 3.3.3. UserInteraction Source Advanced Features

```
Advanced User Source Capabilities:

1. Context-Aware Question Generation:
   - Track conversation history
   - Generate questions that build on previous responses
   - Avoid redundant questions about already confirmed knowledge
   - Prioritize questions that unlock new inference opportunities

2. Incremental Knowledge Building:
   - Each user response immediately integrated into knowledge base
   - New responses trigger inference on related topics
   - Building comprehensive understanding through targeted questions
   - User corrections propagate through entire inference chain

3. Validation Confidence Management:
   - User confirmations: confidence = 1.0 (highest)
   - User corrections: original marked CONFLICTED, new knowledge VERIFIED
   - User uncertainty: maintain lower confidence, seek additional evidence
   - User expertise tracking: weight responses based on demonstrated domain knowledge

4. Bidirectional Learning Loop:
   user response → knowledge validation → enhanced understanding → better questions → more targeted user engagement → deeper knowledge building
```

### 3.4. Continuous Knowledge Building (Expansion/Correction) 

#### 3.4.1. 🎯 **Core Design Innovation: Dynamic Knowledge Evolution**

**Traditional Approach**: Static knowledge base built once, only retrieval during chat  
**Our Revolutionary Approach**: Knowledge base continuously grows and evolves during every interaction

#### 3.4.2. Continuous Expansion Mechanisms

```
1. **Conversational Knowledge Growth**
   Every user interaction potentially adds new knowledge:
   
   user: "What does Parser do?"
   bot: "I deduced Parser handles files. Is this correct?"  
   user: "Yes, specifically XML files"
   → User response becomes new VERIFIED knowledge
   → Triggers inference to build XML-related knowledge
   → Knowledge base expands during conversation
   → Future questions benefit from enhanced understanding

2. **On-Demand Source Processing**
   User points to new information → immediate knowledge building:
   
   user: "Read this PDF and tell me about the methodology"
   system immediately:
   → Processes PDF as new information source
   → Extracts facts, methods, references
   → Runs inference to connect with existing knowledge
   → Knowledge base expands in real-time
   → User gets response based on enhanced knowledge

3. **Recursive Knowledge Building**  
   Knowledge base becomes source for meta-knowledge:
   
   existing knowledge: [10 functions, 5 classes, 8 imports]
   system analyzes patterns:
   → Infers: "This module follows object-oriented design"
   → Knowledge base becomes source for architectural insights
   → Higher-level understanding emerges from existing facts
   → Meta-knowledge enables better responses to design questions

4. **Error-Driven Learning**
   Mistakes become learning opportunities:
   
   bot: "Parser handles JSON files"
   user: "No, it handles XML files"
   system immediately:
   → Marks original knowledge as CONFLICTED
   → Adds user correction as VERIFIED knowledge
   → Updates all related inferences about file formats
   → Propagates correction throughout knowledge network
```

#### 3.4.3. Knowledge Correction and Refinement

```
Correction Propagation System:

1. **Direct Correction Processing**
   user: "The Parser actually handles JSON, not XML"
   
   system response:
   → Locate original knowledge: "Parser handles XML"
   → Mark as CONFLICTED with user evidence
   → Add new VERIFIED knowledge: "Parser handles JSON" 
   → Update confidence: user_correction = 1.0
   → Trace all dependent inferences
   → Update related knowledge about JSON parsing, config formats
   → Re-run inference on updated knowledge network

2. **Cascade Update Mechanism**
   Original: "Parser handles XML" → "System processes XML configs" → "XML validation required"
   Correction: "Parser handles JSON"
   
   cascade updates:
   → "System processes JSON configs" (updated)
   → "JSON validation required" (updated)  
   → "Config format: JSON schema" (new inference)
   → All dependent knowledge automatically updated

3. **Confidence Adjustment**
   correction impact on confidence levels:
   → Corrected knowledge: confidence = 0.0 (CONFLICTED)
   → User-provided knowledge: confidence = 1.0 (VERIFIED)
   → Dependent inferences: recalculated based on new evidence
   → Related patterns: strength adjusted based on correction

4. **Learning from Corrections**
   system tracks correction patterns:
   → Which types of inferences frequently corrected?
   → Which sources tend to need user validation?
   → Adjust inference confidence accordingly
   → Improve future inference accuracy
```

#### 3.4.4. Expansion Through Multiple Trigger Types

```
Knowledge Expansion Triggers:

1. **User Questions** → Knowledge Discovery
   user: "How does authentication work?"
   → System realizes knowledge gap about authentication
   → Searches sources for auth-related code/docs
   → Builds new knowledge about authentication mechanisms
   → Enhances understanding for future auth questions

2. **Source Updates** → Incremental Learning  
   user: "I just updated the README with new installation steps"
   → System re-processes updated README
   → Identifies changes from previous version
   → Adds new knowledge about installation procedures
   → Updates existing knowledge about project setup

3. **Pattern Recognition** → Meta-Learning
   system notices: frequent database operations across modules
   → Triggers inference about data persistence patterns
   → Builds knowledge about system architecture
   → Enables better responses to design questions

4. **Conflict Resolution** → Knowledge Refinement
   conflicting evidence triggers deep analysis:
   → System seeks additional evidence from sources
   → Generates targeted validation questions

### 3.5. Inference System (BFS, DFS, Rigorous)

#### 3.5.1. Breadth-First Knowledge Building

```
BFS Strategy: Build wide knowledge first, then deep insights

Layer-by-Layer Expansion:
  Layer 0: [Facts from all sources] 
  Layer 1: [All possible inferences from Layer 0]
  Layer 2: [All possible inferences from Layer 1]
...continue until no new knowledge

Flexible Inference Algorithm:
  current_layer = all_facts_and_relationships
  while current_layer has items and depth < MAX_DEPTH:
    next_layer = []
    
    // Try different inference patterns:
    for each knowledge_item k in current_layer:
      // Unary inferences (single item analysis)
      unary_inferences = try_unary_inference(k)
      next_layer.add_all(unary_inferences)
      
      // Binary inferences (pairs)
      for each other_item k2 in current_layer where k2 != k:
        binary_inference = try_binary_inference(k, k2)
        if binary_inference: next_layer.add(binary_inference)
        
        // Triplet inferences (three items needed)
        for each third_item k3 in current_layer where k3 != k and k3 != k2:
          triplet_inference = try_triplet_inference(k, k2, k3)
          if triplet_inference: next_layer.add(triplet_inference)
          
    current_layer = next_layer
    depth++

Inference Pattern Examples:
  Unary:    "function_definition" → "this_is_a_utility_function" (pattern analysis)
  Binary:   "class_def" + "inheritance" → "inheritance_relationship"  
  Triplet:  "import" + "class_def" + "usage" → "external_dependency_pattern"
  N-ary:    Multiple related functions → "module_functionality_pattern"
```

**BFS Result Example:**
```
Layer 0: [function_def(parse), function_def(analyze), class_def(Parser)]
Layer 1: [Parser_uses_parse, Parser_uses_analyze, parse_calls_analyze] 
Layer 2: [Parser_is_main_component, parse_analyze_pipeline_pattern]
Layer 3: [codebase_follows_modular_design]
```

##### 3.5.1.1. **Depth-First Knowledge Building** 
*Follow one reasoning chain as deep as possible before exploring alternatives*

```
DFS Strategy: Pick a domain and infer as deeply as possible

Focus areas: 'architecture', 'data_flow', 'error_handling', etc.

Algorithm:
  stack = [seed_knowledge_for_focus_area]
  while stack not empty and depth < MAX_DEPTH:
    current = stack.pop()
    
    // Try all inference patterns for current knowledge
    best_next = find_strongest_inference_from(current, focus_area)
    // This could be unary, binary, triplet, etc. - whatever fits best
    
    if best_next and not already_known(best_next):
      knowledge_base.add(best_next)  // Add to knowledge base immediately
      stack.push(best_next)          // Continue this reasoning chain

Key Differences from BFS:
  - BFS: Explores broadly across all domains at each layer
  - DFS: Follows deep reasoning chains in specific domain
  - Both strategies add knowledge to knowledge_base immediately when found
  
Knowledge Base Update Pattern (Same for Both):
  - When new knowledge inferred → immediately add to knowledge_base
  - This enables incremental knowledge building during inference
  - No difference in update timing between BFS and DFS
```

**DFS Result Example (focus_area='architecture'):**
```
Chain 1: class_def(FastAPI) → inherits(Starlette) → web_framework_pattern → 
         ASGI_architecture → async_request_handling → high_performance_design

Chain 2: function_def(@app.get) → decorator_pattern → routing_mechanism → 
         RESTful_API_design → HTTP_method_mapping → API_endpoint_architecture
```

##### 3.5.1.2. **Strategy Comparison**

| Aspect | Breadth-First | Depth-First |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | Comprehensive across all domains | Deep in specific domains |
| **Knowledge Type** | Broad understanding | Specialized expertise |
| **Use Case** | General Q&A about entire codebase | Focused analysis (architecture, security, etc.) |
| **Processing Time** | Longer (explores everything) | Faster (focused exploration) |
| **Result Quality** | Well-rounded knowledge | Deep domain insights |

**Strategy Selection Logic:**
```
Strategy Selection:
  if user_intent = "overview" or "general_understanding":
    use breadth_first  // Wide coverage across all domains
  elif user_intent = "architecture_analysis" or "security_review":
    use depth_first    // Deep dive into specific area
  elif source_type = "large_codebase":
    use hybrid         // BFS first, then DFS on key areas
  else:
    use breadth_first  // Default to comprehensive
```

### 3.6. System Components

#### 3.6.1. Knowledge Representation System

```
Knowledge Confidence Levels:
  VERIFIED   - 100% certain from direct evidence (confidence = 1.0)
  DEDUCED    - Logically derived, no assumptions (confidence = 0.95)
  UNKNOWN    - Cannot determine from evidence (confidence = 0.0)
  CONFLICTED - Multiple contradictory sources (confidence = 0.0)

Knowledge Structure:
  {
    content: "Class Parser is defined in parser.py"
    type: "class_definition" 
    source: "github_repo:parser.py:15"
    status: VERIFIED
    evidence: [list of supporting knowledge items]
    confidence: 1.0
  }

Conflict Detection and Resolution:
  1. Conflict Detection:
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content semantically (not just exact match)
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Strategy:
     if no_conflict: Add to appropriate collection by status
     elif conflict_detected: Create CONFLICTED knowledge item with all sources
     elif supports_existing: Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
     
  3. Conflict Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen)
```

#### 3.6.2. Rigorous Inference Engine

```
Purpose: Build new knowledge using rigorous evidence-based inference

Strategy Implementation:
  - Breadth-First: Expand knowledge layer by layer across all domains
  - Depth-First: Follow reasoning chains deep in specific focus areas
  - Hybrid: BFS for broad coverage, then DFS for deep insights

Evidence Requirements:
  - Only rigorous inferences using exact matching
  - Every inference must cite source evidence
  - Proper categorization as VERIFIED/DEDUCED/UNKNOWN/CONFLICTED
  - No guessing or fuzzy matching allowed

Flexible Inference Patterns:
  - Unary: Single knowledge item analysis (e.g., "function_definition" → "utility_function")
  - Binary: Pairs of knowledge items (e.g., "class_def" + "inheritance" → "inheritance_relationship")
  - Triplet: Three items needed (e.g., "import" + "class_def" + "usage" → "dependency_pattern")
  - N-ary: Multiple related items → higher-level patterns

Rigorous Inference Rules (only build knowledge that can be PROVEN):
  Rule 1: Function Usage
    if (k1 = function_definition AND k2 = function_call):
      if exact_name_match(k1.name, k2.name):
        create VERIFIED knowledge: "Function X is called at location Y"

  Rule 2: Class Inheritance  
    if (k1 = class_definition AND k2 = inheritance_declaration):
      if exact_parent_match(k1.name, k2.parent):
        create VERIFIED knowledge: "Class X is base class for Y"

  Rule 3: Import Usage
    if (k1 = import_statement AND k2 = symbol_usage):
      if import_provides_symbol(k1, k2.symbol):
        create VERIFIED knowledge: "Module X is used via symbol Y"

Evidence Standards by Inference Type:
  function_usage: Requires exactly 2 pieces of evidence (function_definition + function_call)
  inheritance_relationship: Must have class_definition + inheritance_declaration  
  dependency_usage: Must have import_statement + symbol_usage
  
Handling Uncertainty:
  - If evidence insufficient → create UNKNOWN knowledge
  - If sources contradict → create CONFLICTED knowledge  
  - If no rigorous rule applies → create nothing (don't guess)
```

#### 3.6.3. Information Processing Flow

**Knowledge Base with Conflict Detection:**

```
KnowledgeBase.add_knowledge(new_knowledge):

  1. Conflict Detection:
     - Check if new knowledge contradicts existing knowledge
     - Compare content semantically (not just exact match)
     - Identify potential conflicts across all confidence levels
     
  2. Conflict Resolution Strategy:
     if no_conflict:
       - Add to appropriate collection by status
       - Update source tracking
     elif conflict_detected:
       - Create CONFLICTED knowledge item
       - Include all conflicting sources as evidence
       - Mark original conflicting items as superseded
       - Add conflict to conflicts collection
     elif supports_existing:
       - Strengthen confidence of existing knowledge
       - Add as supporting evidence
       
  3. Knowledge Collections:
     - verified_knowledge: High confidence facts
     - deduced_knowledge: Logical inferences  
     - unknown_items: Cannot determine from evidence
     - conflicts: Contradictory information
     - source_tracker: Maps source_type → knowledge items

  4. Conflict Detection Examples:
     - "Parser handles JSON" vs "Parser handles XML" → CONFLICT
     - "Function foo() takes 2 args" vs "Function foo() takes 3 args" → CONFLICT  
     - "Class A inherits B" + "Class A inherits B" → SUPPORT (strengthen)
```

*Note: Response structure and query processing details are covered in the Query Processing section.*

#### 3.6.4. Unified Information Flow Example

```
User: "What's the purpose of the Parser class?"

Bot: "Based on analysis from multiple sources:
VERIFIED FACTS:
✓ Parser class is defined in parser.py (Source: github_repo)

LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS:
→ Parser appears to process input data (Derived from: 2 sources)

❓ I deduced that Parser appears to process input data. Is this correct?"

User: "Yes, but specifically it parses configuration files"

Bot: [Processes user response as new information source]
"Thank you! I've learned from your response. What else would you like to know?"

User: "How does the Parser work?"

Bot: "VERIFIED FACTS:
✓ Parser class is defined in parser.py (Source: github_repo)
✓ Parser parses configuration files (Source: user_interaction)
..."
```



#### 3.6.5. Core System Components

```
Chat Bot Processing Flow:

1. Input Analysis:
   - New information provided → Process as information source
   - New document referenced → Add source + build knowledge  
   - Question asked → Determine response strategy + build knowledge
   - Confirmation/correction → Update knowledge + trigger inference

2. Knowledge Building Triggers:
   - User confirmations/corrections → Build verified knowledge
   - New documents mentioned → Extract + infer knowledge

```

## 4. Chat Bot System

### 4.1. Query Processing

**Response Generation Strategy:**

```
Query Processing Pipeline:
  1. Question Analysis → Determine query type and response strategy
  2. Knowledge Retrieval → Semantic search + keyword matching from knowledge base
  3. Context Building → Rank by relevance and confidence level
  4. Response Generation → LLM prompt with source constraints and uncertainty indicators

Response Format with Confidence Levels:
  ✓ VERIFIED FACTS: Direct evidence from sources
  → LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS: Rigorous inferences with evidence
  ? UNCLEAR AREAS: Insufficient evidence for determination
  ⚠ CONFLICTING INFORMATION: Contradictory sources requiring clarification

Key Constraints:
  - Only use information from provided sources (no external knowledge)
  - Always cite sources and show confidence levels
  - Generate clarification questions for uncertain knowledge
```

## 5. Web Interface

Purpose: Generate confirmation questions during knowledge building and chat

Components:
  - Uncertainty Detector: Identifies knowledge needing confirmation
  - Question Generator: Creates natural language questions
  - Context Tracker: Links questions to knowledge items
  - Confirmation Processor: Updates knowledge from user feedback

Curiosity Triggers (when to ask questions):
  1. Low Confidence Deductions (confidence < 0.8)
  2. Conflicting Information Detected
  3. Pattern Recognition Uncertainty  
  4. Cross-Source Inconsistencies
  5. Missing Critical Information

Active Confirmation Process:
  1. During knowledge building/inference:
     - Check each new knowledge item for uncertainty
     - Generate confirmation question if needed
     - Add to pending confirmations queue
     
  2. During response generation:
     - Identify knowledge used in response
     - Mark uncertain knowledge for potential confirmation
     - Include confirmation requests in response
     
  3. User feedback processing:
     - Positive confirmation → upgrade confidence to VERIFIED
     - Negative confirmation → create CONFLICTED knowledge
     - User corrections → add new VERIFIED knowledge from user input

Question Types:
  - Deductions: "I deduced X from Y. Is this correct?"
  - Conflicts: "Found conflicting info: A vs B. Which is correct?"
  - Patterns: "I noticed pattern X. Does this make sense?"
  - Gaps: "Couldn't determine X from sources. Can you clarify?"
```

**Verbose Knowledge Display Design:**

```
Purpose: Show users exactly which knowledge was used in responses

Knowledge Tracking Strategy:
  - Record which knowledge items retrieved for each response
  - Track confidence levels and original sources
  - Maintain evidence chains showing how knowledge was derived

Display Format:
  - Group by confidence (Verified → Deduced → Uncertain)
  - Color-code by reliability (Green/Yellow/Red)
  - Show source attribution and evidence chains
  - Expandable details for full context

User Correction Flow:
  - User clicks "This understanding is wrong"
  - Correction dialog opens with comment box
  - User input processed as new verified knowledge
  - Knowledge base updated and inferences re-run
```

**Enhanced Chat Architecture:**

```
Active Confirmation Integration:

chat_with_curiosity() method:
  - Process user input for new information
  - Generate response using current knowledge
  - Simultaneously generate confirmation questions
  - Return response + knowledge metadata + confirmations

process_confirmation() method:
  - Locate original knowledge item
  - Update confidence based on user feedback
  - Process corrections as new verified knowledge
  - Trigger inference updates on corrected knowledge

Benefits:
  - Continuous learning during conversation

## 8. MVP Design and Progressive Development

### 8.1. MVP Progression Strategy

**Development Philosophy**: Start with a minimal but functional system, then add layers of sophistication. Each step should be completable within 1-2 weeks and immediately usable.

### 8.2. MVP 1: Basic File Reading Chat Bot (Weeks 1-2)

**Core Functionality**: Simple Q&A about a single GitHub repository

```
Minimal Components:
- Simple file reader for Python files and documentation
- Basic text chunking and embedding (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Simple RAG retrieval without knowledge building
- Basic Streamlit chat interface
- Only VERIFIED knowledge (no inference)

User Flow:
1. Point bot to GitHub repository folder
2. Bot scans and embeds all .py and .md files
3. User asks questions about the code
4. Bot retrieves relevant chunks and answers

Limitations (acceptable for MVP1):
- No inference or knowledge building
- No confidence levels or uncertainty handling
- Simple keyword/semantic search only
- Single source type (local GitHub repo only)
- No user interaction learning

Success Criteria:
✅ Can answer "What does class Parser do?" by finding relevant code
✅ Can explain function purposes from docstrings and comments
✅ Basic chat interface works reliably
✅ Vector search returns relevant code sections
```

### 8.3. MVP 2: Confidence Levels and Basic Inference (Weeks 3-4)

**Enhancement**: Add simple confidence system and basic knowledge representation

```
New Components:
- Knowledge structure with confidence levels (VERIFIED, UNKNOWN only)
- Basic AST parsing for Python files (extract classes, functions, imports)
- Simple inference rules (function usage, class inheritance)
- Confidence indicators in responses
- Basic conflict detection (same info from multiple sources)

Enhanced User Flow:
1. Bot parses code structure (not just text chunks)
2. Creates VERIFIED knowledge from direct code analysis
3. Applies simple inference rules to build basic relationships
4. Responses show confidence levels with source citations

New Capabilities:
✅ "Function foo() is called by bar()" (derived from AST analysis)
✅ "Class A inherits from B" (direct from code structure)
✅ Response format: "✓ VERIFIED: Class defined in file.py:15"
✅ Basic inheritance and dependency relationships

Limitations (still acceptable):
- Only GitHub repositories
- No user interaction learning yet
- Simple BFS inference only
- No curiosity or question generation
```

### 8.4. MVP 3: User Interaction as Information Source (Weeks 5-6)

**Enhancement**: Treat user confirmations and corrections as knowledge sources

```
New Components:
- UserInteraction source implementation
- Real-time knowledge updating from user feedback
- Basic validation during chat responses
- Simple confirmation tracking and processing

Enhanced User Flow:
1. Bot generates responses with uncertainty indicators
2. Bot asks "❓ I deduced X. Is this correct?" for low-confidence items
3. User confirmations become VERIFIED knowledge
4. User corrections update knowledge base immediately
5. Enhanced knowledge available for next questions

New Capabilities:
✅ "❓ I deduced Parser handles XML. Is this correct?"
✅ User: "Yes" → Updates knowledge confidence to VERIFIED
✅ User: "No, it handles JSON" → Creates new VERIFIED knowledge
✅ Corrections immediately improve subsequent responses
✅ Chat sessions become learning opportunities

Limitations (acceptable for MVP3):
- Single repository only
- Basic inference patterns only
- No deep curiosity engine yet
```

### 8.5. MVP 4: Multi-Source Support (Weeks 7-8)

**Enhancement**: Add support for multiple repository types and PDFs

```
New Components:
- Unified information source interface
- PDF document parsing (PyMuPDF)
- Multiple GitHub repository support
- Source tracking in knowledge items
- Cross-source conflict detection

Enhanced User Flow:
1. User can add multiple sources (repos, PDFs)
2. Bot builds unified knowledge base from all sources
3. Responses cite specific sources for each piece of information
4. Conflicts between sources highlighted for user resolution

New Capabilities:
✅ Support for research paper PDFs
✅ Multiple repositories in one knowledge base
✅ Cross-reference between code and documentation
✅ Source attribution: "(Source: github_repo)" vs "(Source: pdf_document)"
✅ Conflict detection: "Code says X, but docs say Y"

Example Multi-Source Interaction:
user: "How does authentication work?"
bot: "Based on multiple sources:
     ✓ VERIFIED: JWT tokens used (Source: auth.py:45)
     ✓ VERIFIED: Refresh tokens implemented (Source: security_paper.pdf)
     ⚠ CONFLICT: Token expiry (Code: 1 hour, Docs: 24 hours)"
```

### 8.6. MVP 5: Advanced Inference Engine (Weeks 9-10)

**Enhancement**: Add BFS/DFS strategies and deeper knowledge building

```
New Components:
- Configurable inference strategies (BFS/DFS/Hybrid)
- Advanced inference patterns (unary, binary, triplet, n-ary)
- Meta-knowledge building (knowledge base as information source)
- Inference depth controls and stopping criteria

Enhanced User Flow:
1. User selects inference strategy based on needs
2. Bot applies sophisticated reasoning to build deeper insights
3. Architectural patterns and design insights emerge
4. Meta-analysis of knowledge patterns

New Capabilities:
✅ Architectural insight: "System follows microservices pattern"
✅ Design pattern recognition: "Uses decorator pattern for routing"
✅ BFS: Broad understanding across entire codebase
✅ DFS: Deep specialization in specific domains (security, performance)
✅ Strategy selection: "Use DFS for architecture analysis"

Example Advanced Inference:
Layer 0: [FastAPI class, get() function, post() function]
Layer 1: [Web framework pattern, HTTP method handling]
Layer 2: [REST API design, decorator pattern usage]
Layer 3: [Modern Python web architecture philosophy]
```

### 8.7. MVP 6: Curiosity Engine and Active Learning (Weeks 11-12)

**Enhancement**: Add proactive question generation and uncertainty resolution

```
New Components:
- Curiosity engine for question generation
- Uncertainty detection and confidence thresholds
- Active confirmation panel in web interface
- Context-aware question prioritization

Enhanced User Flow:
1. Bot actively identifies knowledge gaps during inference
2. Generates targeted questions to resolve uncertainty
3. Dedicated UI panel for pending confirmations
4. Continuous learning improves question quality

New Capabilities:
✅ Smart question generation: "I noticed error handling patterns. Is this a reliability focus?"
✅ Uncertainty prioritization: Most important gaps addressed first
✅ Context preservation: Questions linked to specific knowledge items
✅ Learning from question patterns: Improves future curiosity

Example Curiosity Flow:
During inference: Bot detects complex error handling across multiple modules
Generated question: "I see extensive error handling. Is system reliability a key design goal?"
User confirms: "Yes, we prioritize fault tolerance"
Knowledge update: Adds "System designed for fault tolerance" as VERIFIED
Inference trigger: Builds additional reliability-related insights
```

### 8.8. MVP 7: Full Production System (Weeks 13-14)

**Enhancement**: Complete system with all advanced features

```
Final Components:
- Database source support (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Production vector database (Qdrant)
- Advanced web interface with all confirmation features
- Comprehensive source management
- Performance optimizations and caching

Full Capabilities:
✅ All source types supported (repos, PDFs, databases, user interaction)
✅ Sophisticated knowledge building with recursive meta-analysis
✅ Production-ready performance and scalability
✅ Complete curiosity engine with intelligent question generation
✅ Enterprise-grade source management and conflict resolution

Production Features:
- Multi-user support with isolated knowledge bases
- API endpoints for programmatic access
- Advanced caching and performance optimization
- Comprehensive logging and analytics
- Deployment scripts and documentation
```

### 8.9. Progressive Validation Strategy

**Validation at Each MVP Stage:**

```
MVP 1-2: Basic Functionality Tests
- Can extract information from code files
- Semantic search returns relevant results
- Chat interface responds appropriately

MVP 3-4: Learning and Multi-Source Tests  
- User corrections properly update knowledge
- Multiple sources integrate without conflicts
- Knowledge attribution accurate

MVP 5-6: Advanced Reasoning Tests
- Inference strategies produce expected insights
- Curiosity questions are relevant and helpful
- Knowledge building creates valuable patterns

MVP 7: Production Readiness Tests
- Performance meets enterprise requirements
- System handles large repositories efficiently
- All edge cases properly handled
```

### 8.10. Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Each MVP Is Independently Useful:**

```
Risk: Complex features might not work as planned
Mitigation: Each MVP delivers immediate value

Risk: Development might get stuck on difficult inference logic
Mitigation: MVP 1-3 work without complex inference

Risk: User interaction learning might be too complex
Mitigation: MVP 1-2 provide value without user learning

Risk: Multi-source integration might have unexpected challenges
Mitigation: MVP 1-3 work with single source

Key Principle: Always have a working system, progressively enhanced
```

This MVP progression ensures you have a working chat bot quickly, with each enhancement adding meaningful value. Each step is small enough to complete successfully while building toward the full vision.

## 9. Implementation Guidelines

### 9.1. Critical Implementation Notes

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **Repository Structure**: Create modular Python package with clear separation: `nexus/sources/`, `nexus/knowledge/`, `nexus/inference/`, `nexus/chat/`, `nexus/web/`
- **Configuration Management**: Use Pydantic for all configuration classes to maintain type safety
- **Error Handling**: Follow fail-fast principle - use assertions for input validation, only catch expected exceptions
- **Testing Strategy**: Test each MVP increment independently with integration tests

**Essential Starting Points for MVP 1:**
1. Create `InformationSource` abstract base class first
2. Implement `GitHubRepo` source with basic file reading
3. Create simple `Knowledge` data class with confidence levels
4. Build basic ChromaDB integration for vector storage
5. Set up Streamlit interface with file upload

**Critical Success Metrics:**
- **MVP 1**: Answer basic questions about code files within 30 seconds
- **MVP 3**: User corrections improve subsequent responses immediately  
- **MVP 5**: Generate architectural insights that match human expert analysis
- **MVP 7**: Handle enterprise-scale repositories (10K+ files) efficiently

### 9.2. Development Best Practices

**Code Organization:**
```
nexus/
├── sources/           # Information source implementations
├── knowledge/         # Knowledge representation and storage
├── inference/         # BFS/DFS inference engines  
├── chat/             # Query processing and response generation
├── web/              # Streamlit interface components
├── utils/            # Shared utilities and helpers
└── tests/            # Comprehensive test suite
```

**Key Implementation Priorities:**
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with MVP 1 basic functionality
2. **Validate Early**: Test each component with real repository data
3. **User Feedback**: Implement user interaction learning as early as MVP 3
4. **Performance**: Profile and optimize vector operations from MVP 1
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear API documentation for extensibility

This plan provides complete guidance for building Nexus from initial concept to production-ready knowledge chat bot.
