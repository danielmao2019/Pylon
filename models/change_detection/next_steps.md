  - SHREC2023: Updated version of the street-level point cloud dataset
  - Contains both real LiDAR data (2016/2020) and synthetic city scenes
- **Key Features**:
  - SiamVFE: Uses voxel feature encoding for point cloud change detection
  - SiamGCN-GCA: Enhances SiamGCN with Graph Context Attention mechanisms
  - Improved performance over the original SiamGCN architecture
- **Integration Notes**:
  - More advanced than original SiamGCN with additional attention mechanisms
  - Provides both voxel-based and graph-based approaches for comparison
  - Extension of the original SiamGCN with additional capabilities

### 4. SiamKPConv Variants (OneConvFusion, Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv, Triplet KPConv)
- **Paper**: "Change detection needs change information: improving deep 3D point cloud change detection" (2023)
  - Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12639
- **Implementation Resources**:
  - Official repository: https://github.com/IdeGelis/torch-points3d-SiamKPConvVariants
  - Contains implementations of multiple SiamKPConv variants:
    - OneConvFusion: Introduces change information early in the network
    - Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv: Uses multi-level feature fusion
    - Triplet KPConv: Three-stream architecture for change detection
  - Built on top of the Torch-Points3D framework
- **Benchmark Dataset**:
  - Urb3DCD: Urban point cloud simulated dataset with various qualities
  - Includes low/high resolution with different noise levels
  - Publicly available at: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/urb3dcd-urban-point-clouds-simulated-dataset-3d-change-detection
- **Key Features**:
  - Improves upon SiamKPConv by incorporating change information in early network stages
  - Outperforms previous state-of-the-art by more than 5% on mean IoU for change classes
  - Better fusion of temporal information
- **Integration Notes**:
  - Could be implemented as an extension/improvement to our existing SiameseKPConv
  - Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv offers the best performance among the variants
