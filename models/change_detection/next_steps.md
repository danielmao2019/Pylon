# Next Steps for 3D Point Cloud Change Detection Models

## Current Implementation Status
We currently have implemented:
- SiameseKPConv: A Siamese network based on KPConv for 3D point cloud change detection

## Recommended Models for Implementation

### 1. SiamGCN (Siamese Graph Convolutional Network)
- **Paper**: "3D Urban Change Detection with Point Cloud Siamese Networks" (ISPRS 2021)
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses EdgeConv operators to extract representative features from point clouds
  - Employs a Siamese architecture based on graph convolutional networks
  - Excellent for urban scene analysis and street-level change detection
- **Implementation Resources**:
  - Original code: https://github.com/kutao207/SiamGCN
  - Enhanced version: SiamGCN-GCA available at https://github.com/grgzam/SiamVFE_SiamGCN-GCA
- **Integration Notes**:
  - Would complement SiameseKPConv with graph-based feature learning
  - Particularly effective for sparse point cloud data

### 2. ChangeGAN
- **Paper**: "ChangeGAN: A Deep Network for Change Detection in Coarsely Registered Point Clouds" (IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, Vol. 6, 2021)
- **Key Features**:
  - Generative adversarial network for point cloud change detection
  - Robust to registration errors and alignment issues
  - Works with coarsely registered point clouds
- **Integration Notes**:
  - Would add capability to handle imperfectly aligned point cloud data
  - GAN-based approach offers a different learning paradigm compared to existing models

### 3. Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv
- **Paper**: "Change detection needs change information: improving deep 3D point cloud change detection" (2023)
- **Key Features**:
  - Improves upon SiamKPConv by incorporating change information in early network stages
  - Outperforms previous state-of-the-art by more than 5% on mean IoU for change classes
  - Better fusion of temporal information
- **Integration Notes**:
  - Could be implemented as an extension/improvement to our existing SiameseKPConv
