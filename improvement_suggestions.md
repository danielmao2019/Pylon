#### Task 10: Remove unnecessary try-catch blocks
**Problem**: Excessive try-catch blocks hide error sources and make debugging inefficient
**Solution**: Remove unnecessary error handling, let Python's natural stack traces show exact error locations, keep only API compatibility exceptions
**Justification**: Clear error propagation improves debugging efficiency - hiding errors makes problems harder to diagnose and fix

#### Task 11: Add missing type annotations
**Problem**: Missing type annotations reduce IDE support and make code harder to understand
**Solution**: Add comprehensive type annotations for function arguments and return values, especially in core framework components
**Justification**: Type safety prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience with better IDE autocomplete and error detection

#### Task 12: Identify and discuss code duplication patterns
**Problem**: Code duplication across modules increases maintenance burden and creates inconsistency risks
**Solution**: Systematically identify duplicated patterns, propose refactoring strategies, and create reusable abstractions
**Justification**: Reducing duplication improves maintainability - changes need to be made in one place rather than multiple locations

## Medium Priority Tasks (5 items)

### Performance Optimizations (3 tasks)
